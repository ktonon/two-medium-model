# The Cosmic Microwave Background in an Infinite 2MM Universe

What follows is an application of the Two-Medium Model (2MM) to the cosmic-background-radiation. Please read the [Cosmological Redshift](./cosmological-redshift.md) page first.

If you are new to the framework, the top-level [README](./README.md) provides an introduction to its core ideas.

---

The Two-Medium Model begins from a bold but simple premise: the universe is infinite, both in space and in time. No edge, no beginning, no expanding fabric. Instead, everything we observe emerges from the continual exchange of energy between two intertwined media—the ultra-fast GCM corpuscles and the elastic LCM in which matter and light reside.

The challenge, of course, is that the night sky is dark. An infinite universe filled with luminous objects ought to blaze like a star, yet it doesn’t. And on top of that paradox sits the Cosmological Microwave Background, a faint but perfectly uniform glow at 2.7 K that modern cosmology treats as the afterglow of a primordial explosion.

The goal here is to show how the 2MM picture resolves these puzzles naturally, without invoking a Big Bang or cosmic expansion. The answers follow directly from the way light behaves as it travels through the low-density LCM of intergalactic voids.

## 1. The Starting Point: Olbers’ Paradox in an Infinite Universe

Olbers’ paradox is simple:
If the universe is infinite and filled with stars, then every line of sight should eventually encounter a star. Adding up all those contributions should make the night sky as bright as a stellar surface.

But it isn’t. Why?

Traditional explanations invoke:

* a finite-age universe,
* an expanding metric that redshifts distant light,
* or a finite horizon set by cosmic history.

The 2MM rejects all three.
So the paradox must be resolved in a way consistent with:

* **an infinite universe**,
* **constant statistical equilibrium**,
* **cosmological redshift arising from LCM → GCM energy drift**,
* **no global evolution of average properties over time**.

The solution actually follows directly from the [redshift mechanism](./cosmological-redshift.md).

## 2. Light Traveling Through Voids: A Slow Energy Drift

In the 2MM, photons traveling through intergalactic voids pass through extremely low-density LCM. In these regions, the GCM flux has been partially depleted by its earlier interactions inside galaxies. The local balance between the two media is shifted: the LCM (carrying long-range waves like starlight) is effectively “hotter” than the weakened GCM flux around it.

That imbalance drives a **tiny, forward-coherent transfer of momentum from LCM to GCM**. To the photon, this appears as a slight loss of energy—a redshift that accumulates over vast distances.

Crucially:

* the interaction is extremely gentle,
* it does not scatter the photon appreciably,
* and it depends only on conditions in voids, not on cosmic age.

This is the 2MM explanation for cosmological redshift:
**A photon gradually cools as it traverses low-density, weak-flux environments.**

## 3. Applying This Mechanism to an Infinite Universe

Now imagine all the starlight in an infinite cosmos subject to this effect.

Every photon emitted from a distant star:

* travels through voids for millions or billions of light-years,
* gives up a tiny fraction of energy over and over,
* gradually shifts from visible to infrared,
* then from infrared to microwave,
* and finally into extremely low-energy radio waves.

Given enough distance—and in an infinite universe, there is always enough distance—light from remote stars becomes so redshifted that it no longer contributes to the visible sky at all.

This alone eliminates Olbers’ paradox:

> **The night sky is dark because almost all faraway light has been cooled into microwaves and longer wavelengths before reaching us.**

No finite-age universe is required.
No expanding metric is required.
Redshift alone does the job.

## 4. Where Does the Lost Energy Go?

Energy cannot simply disappear.
Every redshifted photon has given up its energy to the GCM flux in voids.

Those voids are enormous, filled with GCM corpuscles continuously absorbing:

* the faint, cooled remnants of starlight,
* the low-frequency tail of galactic radiation,
* and any long-wavelength modes that propagate without interacting strongly with matter.

Because light flows in from all directions, and because voids occupy most of the universe’s volume, the GCM in these regions absorbs a tremendous amount of energy over time.

But equilibrium demands that this absorbed energy not accumulate indefinitely.
And indeed, the GCM continually redistributes it back into the LCM through extremely gentle interactions.

The result is an ambient “glow”—a stable background temperature that reflects the balance between:

* energy drained from photons (LCM → GCM), and
* energy redistributed back into the LCM (GCM → LCM).

This glow is what we observe as the cosmic microwave background.

## 5. The CMB as the Equilibrium Temperature of Voids

In the 2MM picture, the CMB is not a relic of a hot beginning. It is:

> **the steady-state equilibrium between the slow cooling of light in voids and the continual recycling of that energy by the GCM.**

The key features of the observed CMB fall naturally into place:

#### Uniformity

Void conditions are extremely uniform across cosmic scales. The background temperature reflects that uniformity.

#### Blackbody Spectrum

A medium that continually exchanges energy between two coupled fields (GCM and LCM) inevitably reaches a thermal distribution. The resulting equilibrium spectrum is a blackbody.

#### Temperature (~2.7 K)

This is simply the equilibrium point where:

* the energy lost by photons during cosmological redshift
* is balanced by
* the GCM’s redistribution of energy back into the LCM.

The temperature does not encode the age of the universe; it encodes **the balance point of an infinitely old system.**

## 6. A Universe Maintained by Voids

In this view, voids serve a critical cosmological role:

* **Galaxies drain the GCM flux**, taking in energy to maintain their structure.
* **Voids recharge the GCM flux**, receiving energy from passing photons.
* **The balance of these two processes keeps the universe in equilibrium.**

Thus the CMB is not a leftover from a fireball.
It is the ongoing whisper of an infinite universe maintaining its internal balance.

## 7. The Clean Aesthetic of the 2MM Solution

What makes this explanation compelling is its simplicity:

* No beginning or end.
* No global evolution of physics.
* No cosmological expansion.
* No mysterious inflationary era.
* Just the natural outcome of two media interacting across vastly different density regimes.

Redshift is not a clue to a stretching metric.
The CMB is not the remnant of a cosmic explosion.
Both are signatures of a universe that has always been here, always in motion, sustained by the interplay between GCM and LCM across galaxies and voids.
