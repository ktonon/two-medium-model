# Two Medium Model (2MM)

The Two-Medium Model (2MM) proposes that the universe is built from the
interaction of two fundamental substrates: *(i)* the **Light-Carrying
Medium (LCM)**, a compressible elastic medium that supports transverse
waves (light), longitudinal modes, and the standing-wave structures we
call matter; and *(ii)* the **Gravity-Carrying Medium (GCM)**, a
pervasive flux of ultra-small, ultra-fast corpuscles whose flow is
partially blocked by dense LCM regions, producing gravitational
attraction through flux-shadowing.

Matter arises as standing waves in the LCM stabilized by GCM flux.
Gravity results from momentum imbalance in the GCM. Electrostatic,
electromagnetic, and nuclear binding forces all arise from the dynamic
balance maintained between the two media. Cosmological
redshift arises from the gradual, non-scattering loss of energy
from LCM transverse waves into the GCM. The CMB is the accumulated
remnant of this process in an infinite universe. The conceptual origin of 2MM
lies in the Meta Model, which proposed that two interacting substrates
are necessary to capture the richness of physical phenomena. This
framework, while qualitative, offers a physically intuitive ontology
unifying microphysics and cosmology and suggests avenues for future
formalization and testing.

# Preface

This document is an attempt to answer a question that has interested me
for many years: *Is it possible to build a coherent, medium-based
picture of physics that connects phenomena across scales, from particles
to cosmology, using simple and intuitive principles?*

I approached this project not as a professional physicist but as an
amateur who has spent decades reading about science, puzzles, and
anomalies that invite deeper questioning. My interest has always leaned
toward the edges of what we understand: places where standard
explanations work mathematically but remain conceptually opaque, or
where observations fit uneasily into the prevailing frameworks.

The ideas presented here began with a few philosophical commitments:
that interactions should be local, that waves require a medium, and that
forces should have physical carriers rather than operating at a
distance. These assumptions are not universally accepted, and they are
not proposed as corrections to modern physics. They simply provided a
different starting point, one that led me to explore whether a
medium-based ontology might unify many disconnected pieces of physical
behavior.

This is a conceptual model: exploratory and intentionally not defined
mathematically. My hope is that general readers find it accessible, and
that professionals find it interesting enough to question, critique, or
even refine. Science progresses not only through detailed calculation,
but also through new ways of seeing familiar things.

# Introduction

The Two-Medium Model (2MM) is a conceptual framework developed to
explore whether many pieces of modern physics might be understood more
intuitively if reinterpreted through two interacting physical media.
This includes particle behavior, forces, gravity, cosmology, and certain
geophysical observations. The goal of this work is not to dispute the
empirical success of established theories such as quantum field theory
or general relativity, but to examine whether a medium-based ontology
can offer a unified geometric picture that connects phenomena across
scales.

Modern physics is extraordinarily effective at describing what happens,
yet often agnostic about *what things are*. Fields are treated as
mathematical entities, forces arise from operators or curvature rather
than physical mechanisms, and fundamental particles are defined by their
properties rather than by internal structure. These approaches work, but
they leave open the question of whether a more physically intuitive
model might also exist. Even better, if such a model did exist that it
might provide **new** insights.

The Two-Medium Model starts from a small set of philosophical
assumptions: that interactions are local, that waves require a medium,
and that gravity must be physically mediated. These assumptions are
neither new nor universally accepted, but they open a path to
constructing an alternative conceptual picture that remains grounded in
observed phenomena. Beginning from these premises, the model introduces
two distinct media: a compressible medium that supports transverse waves
(LCM) and a high-speed particulate flux that produces gravitational
shadowing (GCM). Matter, forces, and other phenomena are interpreted as
emerging from the interaction between these two components.

This document summarizes the resulting framework. It is not a formal
theory and does not attempt to replicate the mathematical precision of
modern physics. Instead, it offers a structured conceptual model that
appears internally coherent and that naturally produces explanations for
a range of phenomena, from electric charge and magnetism to nuclear
structure, planetary mass growth, redshift, and the function of active
galactic nuclei. Some of these explanations parallel mainstream
thinking; others are unconventional. All are presented with the
intention of sparking curiosity and inviting further analysis.

Each section of this paper should be read in order, the model benefits
from seeing how its pieces interlock: forces emerging from medium
interactions, particles from wave collapse, cosmology from matter
cycling, and planetary behavior from long-term LCM dynamics.

This work is offered as an exploration — an attempt to see what
becomes possible when we start with different foundational assumptions
and follow them consistently. If it prompts reflection, critique, or
further development by readers more skilled or knowledgeable than
myself, then it has achieved its purpose.

# Predictions

Although 2MM is not defined mathematically, it does make several
qualitative predictions that differ from standard interpretations and
could, in principle, be tested. These predictions arise directly from
the model's internal mechanisms: wave collapse, LCM/GCM interactions,
particle structure, and the matter-creation/destruction cycle.

1.  **A 12-hour diurnal variation in high-energy particle events** (a
    modern aether test based on LCM bow/wake asymmetry)

2.  **[Hydrogen creation inside planets and
    moons](#earth-and-the-solar-system)** (and liquid water worlds
    should be abundant)

3.  **[Cosmic voids as repulsive regions](#voids-as-repulsive-regions)**

4.  **[Neutron destruction occurring inside active galactic
    nuclei](#matter-destruction-in-ultra-dense-environments)** (as part
    of the matter-recycling cycle)

5.  **[SETI is unlikely to succeed](#absolute-time)**, even if advanced
    civilizations exist

Each of these will be discussed in greater detail in relevant sections
below.

# Core Ontology: Two Interacting Media

The Two-Medium Model begins with a simple idea: the physical world
arises from the interaction of two different substrates. One medium
carries waves and can form standing-wave particles. The other supplies a
fast-moving background flux that shapes how those waves behave and how
particles influence one another. Most of the complexity of physics, in
this picture, comes not from many different forces, but from the way
these two media continually feed back on each other.

## The LCM: A Medium for Waves and Matter

The Light-Carrying Medium (LCM) is a compressible substance that can
support both transverse and longitudinal disturbances. Transverse waves
correspond to what we normally call light. Longitudinal
disturbances—changes in density that ripple outward—play the role
usually assigned to gravitational waves, since both travel at the same
characteristic speed in the LCM.

What makes the LCM especially important is how it stores and manipulates
energy. It can hold energy as density gradients, torsional motion, or
shear patterns, and under extreme conditions it can reorganize traveling
waves into localized standing structures. These standing waves become
what we recognize as matter. Because the LCM deforms around these
structures, it also shapes how the GCM flux interacts with them,
indirectly setting the stage for every familiar force.

The LCM does not independently "produce" electric or magnetic fields.
Instead, the deformations it carries—compression patterns, twists, and
gradients—provide half of the mechanism that later becomes
electrostatic, magnetic, and nuclear behavior. In this model, electric
and magnetic fields are simply the ways compressed or twisted regions of
the LCM guide the flow of the GCM.

## The GCM: A Fast Flux That Generates Forces

The Gravity-Carrying Medium (GCM) is a very different kind of substrate.
It consists of an ultra-fast, high-flux stream of tiny particles moving
through space. When these particles pass through matter, a small
fraction of them interact in slightly inelastic ways. These tiny
encounters create "shadows" in the flux, which show up as the force we
call gravity.

The strength of a shadow depends on the structure of the LCM around the
particle. A tightly compressed standing wave blocks or redirects more of
the GCM than a loose one, so momentum flows inward more strongly. In
this way, the GCM does not just produce gravity—it participates in
everything from the cohesion of atomic nuclei to the subtle repulsive
and attractive forces that arise between charged particles.

Crucially, the GCM and LCM are deeply interdependent. The GCM shapes the
LCM by pushing on it, compressing it, or twisting it around standing
waves. And the LCM, in return, determines how much of the GCM penetrates
or is scattered by a region. Together, they create the entire landscape
of forces we observe. Later sections discuss how this interaction also
avoids the overheating problem that plagued earlier LeSage-type
theories.

In this ontology, the GCM provides the **momentum-transfer component**
of all physical interactions, while the LCM provides the **geometric and
structural component**. What we call "forces" emerge from the interplay
between the two.

Although the individual ingredients of this framework—the idea of a
wave-supporting medium, a momentum-carrying flux, and standing waves as
particles—each have historical precedents, their combination into a
single interacting system is what gives 2MM its explanatory power. By
treating the LCM and GCM as mutually shaping components of one physical
ontology, the model brings together ideas that were previously separate
and shows how they can work together to produce the full range of
observed phenomena.

## Very Different Scales: Why Two Media Can Coexist

A key feature of 2MM is that the two media do not operate at the same
scale. The LCM behaves like a smooth, continuous medium at the scales
relevant to light and matter. The GCM, by contrast, is made of extremely
small, extremely fast particles. This large separation in scale is what
allows both media to occupy the same space without simply behaving like
one blended substance.

In the spirit of Tom Van Flandern's meta-model, the GCM particles are
taken to be **far smaller than any length scale we can currently
probe**, effectively much smaller than the Planck length for practical
purposes. Their role is not to form visible structure, but to provide a
nearly uniform, ultra-fine background flux that transfers momentum.
Because these particles are so small and so numerous, they can stream
through the LCM with almost no disturbance, except in regions where the
LCM is highly compressed or organized into standing waves.

The GCM flux is also assumed to move **much faster than light**. This
idea, again inspired by TVF's arguments for a superluminal gravity
medium, allows gravitational effects (in the shadowing sense) to
propagate effectively instantaneously at the scales we observe, without
conflicting with the observed behavior of light. In 2MM, light is
limited by the properties of the LCM, while the GCM operates on a
deeper, faster layer.

This separation of scale and speed has three important consequences:

- The **LCM** can carry waves and form standing-wave particles without
  being torn apart by the GCM.

- The **GCM** can provide a persistent, high-speed momentum flux that
  responds sensitively to LCM compression and standing-wave structure.

- Together, they can generate complex behaviors: gravity, fields, and
  forces; without requiring either medium alone to "do everything."

2MM builds on these scale assumptions and extends them: the GCM is not
only a gravity carrier, but also the mechanism that confines standing
waves, maintains particle compression, and couples to LCM deformations
to produce all familiar interactions. The extreme smallness and high
speed of the GCM particles are what make it possible for the two media
to coexist and yet play very different physical roles.

# Matter as Standing Waves in the LCM

Many earlier physical models have attempted to describe matter as some
form of localized wave. Classical ether theories imagined particles as
knots or disturbances in a single universal medium. More recent "elastic
aether" approaches propose that mass, charge, and quantum behavior arise
from deformations or resonances in an elastic or fluid vacuum.
Soliton-based models likewise treat matter as stable wave packets in
nonlinear fields. These ideas share a common intuition: matter may be an
organized pattern of motion rather than a separate substance.

What remains unresolved in all single-medium approaches, however, is the
**problem of confinement**. In a uniform elastic medium, waves disperse;
they do not naturally remain localized. A stable, particle-like standing
wave requires some form of boundary condition or trapping mechanism, but
a single-medium ether does not provide a clear physical origin for such
boundaries. This limitation has historically constrained the explanatory
reach of wave-as-matter theories.

2MM addresses the problem of standing-wave confinement by introducing a
second substrate, the GCM, whose ultra-fast particulate flux interacts
with the LCM. When transverse LCM waves concentrate into a small region,
they locally reduce the incoming GCM flux, creating a gravitational
shadow. This shadow increases the surrounding LCM compression, and the
increased compression further confines the wave. The feedback continues
until the system reaches a stable equilibrium. The wave becomes
**trapped in a gravity-induced compression well of its own making**,
forming a localized, self-sustaining standing wave. This cannot be
overstated: **a separate substrate is required to stabilize standing
waves in the LCM**.

This dual-medium interaction supplies a natural mechanism for the
existence of stable matter waves—something difficult to obtain in any
single-medium framework. To my knowledge, no prior model combines a
compressible light-carrying medium with a separate gravitational flux in
such a way that **confinement, particle structure, and gravitational
response emerge from the same underlying dynamics**.

The ability of 2MM to explain how standing waves become self-confined is
one of the model's strongest conceptual features. It allows matter to
arise not as an arbitrary postulate, but as a natural consequence of how
two complementary media shape and reinforce one another.

## Frequency, Compression, and the Threshold for Collapse

A key consequence of this picture is that the stability of light depends
on its transparency to the GCM. At low frequencies, LCM waves are
diffuse in absolute space and interact negligibly with the GCM flux.
They travel freely, their structure restored by the elastic properties
of the LCM.

When a light wave moves into a region of higher LCM compression, for
example entering the gravitational field of a planet or star, it
blueshifts. That is, it's frequency increases and the wave's spatial
extent shrinks. The crests bunch closer together, the oscillation
occupies a smaller physical region, and energy density rises. From the
GCM perspective, the wave becomes a denser and more coherent target.

This leads to a simple but profound rule:

> **Blueshifting waves progressively increase their effective
> cross-section to the GCM flux.**

At some point, the wave ceases to be transparent. The GCM begins
scattering off it strongly enough to cast a real shadow. The shadow
compresses the nearby LCM, which in turn constricts the wave. A positive
feedback loop takes over. Eventually the compression crosses a critical
threshold and the traveling wave loses the ability to maintain its
extended form. This is the onset of collapse.

Regions with high LCM density (such as near massive bodies or inside
planets) naturally compress incoming waves, increasing both their local
frequency and their opacity to the GCM. This explains why
electron/positron pair production is favored in such environments:

- **High local LCM density → higher local optical frequency**

- **Higher optical frequency → increased GCM cross-section**

- **Increased GCM opacity → stronger shadowing**

- **Shadowing → collapse into standing waves**

Thus pair production is a natural consequence of the dual-medium
interaction. It occurs when a traveling wave becomes sufficiently
compact—and therefore sufficiently opaque to the GCM—that the only
stable configuration remaining is a pair of standing-wave particles with
complementary phase structures.

## Dual-Mode Helical Standing Waves: The Structure of Matter

Once a high-frequency LCM wave becomes sufficiently opaque to the GCM,
the resulting shadow forces the wave to collapse into a tightly
localized configuration. But the collapse cannot produce an arbitrary
structure. It must preserve symmetry, conserve energy, and yield a
stable pattern that both media—the LCM and GCM—can support.

The only configurations that satisfy these conditions are **standing
waves composed of two coupled oscillation modes**:

1.  a **radial compression–expansion mode**, and

2.  a **torsional shear mode**.

These two oscillation modes—one compression-like and one
torsional—correspond to the familiar electric and magnetic components
of light. In freely propagating waves, these components travel together
in a coordinated way, consistent with electromagnetic behavior. However,
a traveling wave does not need, and does not naturally adopt, the
special self-reinforcing phase pattern required to remain confined in
one place. It simply moves forward without forming a bound structure.

During GCM-induced collapse, the situation changes completely. As the
wave becomes opaque to the GCM, the shadow it casts compresses the
surrounding LCM and forces the energy into a shrinking region. Under
this confinement, the two oscillation modes become strongly coupled.
Their timing settles into a fixed, self-sustaining phase relationship,
creating a stable helical standing wave. This locked configuration is
what gives rise to a particle-like structure in the model.

This helical form is not arbitrary. It arises directly from combining a
radial pulse with a torsional twist in fixed phase relationship. And its
orientation depends entirely on which oscillation leads:

- If the torsional mode **leads** the radial mode, the result is the
  **lead-mode helix**.

- If the torsional mode **lags** slightly, the result is the **lag-mode
  helix**.

These two helices are **mirror images**, equal in energy but opposite in
chirality. They naturally correspond to the two particles produced in
pair creation:

- the **lead-mode helix** → the electron

- the **lag-mode helix** → the positron

Their opposite chirality accounts for their opposite electric charge,
while their identical energy follows from the symmetry of the collapse.
The helical geometry also explains familiar particle properties:

- **Electric charge** arises from the sign and orientation of the radial
  compression field.

- **Magnetic dipoles** emerge from the torsional component.

- **Spin and helicity** follow from the structural chirality of the
  standing wave.

- **Stability** is maintained because the standing wave casts a strong
  GCM shadow, which continually reinforces the LCM compression well that
  confines it.

In this way, the dual-mode helical standing wave becomes the fundamental
unit of matter in 2MM. Electrons and positrons are not abstract point
particles but structured, self-sustaining oscillations, stabilized by
the feedback loop between the LCM and GCM. Their form is the direct
outcome of the symmetry and dynamics of collapse at the threshold where
a high-frequency wave becomes opaque to the GCM.

## The Origin and Motivation for LCM Compression Fields

In the Two-Medium Model, a localized standing wave in the LCM is
surrounded by a region of increased LCM compression. This "compression
field" gives the particle a finite spatial extent and governs how it
interacts with both the LCM and the GCM. The GCM shadow produced by a
concentrated oscillation provides a natural source of inward momentum
flux, but the *shape* of the resulting compression field depends on how
the standing wave itself couples to the medium.

In the previous section, we described particles as helical standing
waves composed of two oscillatory components: a radial compression mode
and a torsional mode. A central idea—introduced here—is that the
**relative phase** of these two modes determines how the boundary of the
standing wave exchanges momentum with the LCM. The goal is to explain
why the lead-mode (electron) and lag-mode (positron) do not produce
identical compression environments, but instead exhibit **opposite
radial tendencies**:

- a **push-outward** bias for the lead mode,

- and a **pull-inward** bias for the lag mode.

A simple linear coupling does **not** produce this behaviour. Therefore,
the model makes the following explicit working assumption:

**Assumption:** *The two phase-locked helical modes interact with the
LCM in a nonlinear way that results in opposite radial biases—one
tending to displace LCM outward, and the other tending to draw it
inward. These opposite tendencies shape the particle's surrounding
compression field.*

This assumption is motivated by these considerations:

- **Concentrated oscillations already generate inward confinement
  through the GCM shadow.** The collapse of a high-frequency LCM wave
  into a standing structure increases its opacity to the GCM flux. The
  resulting shadow produces a persistent inward momentum pressure. This
  effect provides the baseline confinement needed for any stable
  compression field.

- **Opposite radial biases are a plausible outcome of nonlinear mode
  coupling.** The compression oscillation itself naturally introduces
  nonlinearity, because local LCM density—and therefore wave
  speed—varies over the cycle. In many physical systems with this kind
  of nonlinear coupling, two phase-locked modes can settle into distinct
  stable states with opposite radial tendencies. This makes an
  inward–outward asymmetry between the two helical modes a physically
  reasonable possibility, even though the detailed microphysical
  mechanism has not yet been derived.

- **With this push–pull asymmetry in place, the model gains explanatory
  coherence across domains.** This inward–outward asymmetry is a
  cornerstone of the broader framework. Once assumed, it leads to a set
  of coherent predictions that align with observations across multiple
  domains—planetary structure, stellar environments, large-scale
  cosmology, and even the qualitative behaviour of the fundamental
  forces. The fact that these diverse implications emerge from a single
  underlying assumption is part of what motivates exploring the
  Two-Medium Model, even while the microphysical mechanism behind the
  asymmetry remains an open problem.

In summary, the existence of an inward- and outward-biased pair of
helical modes is an **assumed but physically motivated feature** of the
model. The GCM shadow provides the overall inward confinement; the
asymmetric coupling between torsion and compression shapes how each mode
modifies the surrounding LCM. A full dynamical derivation of this
push–pull behaviour remains an open problem for future work.

## The Proton: Why the Lag-Mode Collapses in Dense LCM

The electron and positron arise when a high-frequency LCM wave becomes
opaque to the GCM and collapses into two helical standing-wave modes.
But under certain extreme conditions—particularly in regions where the
**ambient LCM density is already high**—the lag-mode structure behaves
in a qualitatively different way. It does not merely stabilize as a
positron. Instead, it undergoes a **secondary collapse** into a much
more compact standing wave: the proton.

The key lies in how the two chiral modes respond to rising LCM
compression.

The **lead-mode** (electron-like) standing wave resists compression. Its
phase alignment tends to push outward, thickening the surrounding LCM
compression field in a way that counteracts further inward collapse.
Even in dense environments, the lead-mode maintains its characteristic
size and structure.

The **lag-mode**, however, responds in the opposite way. Its phase
alignment draws LCM inward, amplifying the local compression rather than
resisting it. Under ordinary surface-of-Earth conditions, this inward
pull is far too weak to overcome the ambient LCM pressure; the
surrounding medium simply "pushes back," stabilizing the lag-mode as the
familiar positron.

But in environments where the LCM is **already highly
compressed**—deep inside planets, in dense plasma regions, or wherever
steep LCM gradients exist—the lag-mode's inward pull becomes
effective. The ambient medium no longer resists; it *assists* the
contraction. The standing wave therefore begins to tighten, its helical
radius shrinks, and its GCM opacity rises dramatically.

A runaway process begins:

1.  **Contraction increases the GCM shadow.**

2.  **A stronger shadow increases inward GCM pressure.**

3.  **Inward pressure tightens the standing wave even further.**

The structure collapses into a new equilibrium—one that is far more
compact, with vastly greater energy density, and a much deeper GCM
shadow. This new configuration is the **proton**.

The proton therefore is not just a "heavier version" of the positron. It
is the **collapsed-state form** of the lag-mode standing wave under
conditions where external LCM compression allows the inward phase
dynamics to succeed. Its key properties follow naturally:

- a much smaller radius

- a deeper and more intense LCM compression field

- vastly higher GCM opacity

- far greater stability

- the same positive charge as the positron (same chirality, different
  scale)

This explains why protons are ubiquitous in environments where pair
production is possible but LCM density is high, such as inside planetary
interiors. The environment selects the mode: the lead-mode stabilizes as
the electron, while the lag-mode collapses into the proton.

The proton's stability is not a coincidence; it is the endpoint of a
feedback loop between the internal standing-wave geometry and the
surrounding media. Once formed, the proton's extreme GCM opacity locks
it into a self-sustaining compression well, creating the remarkably
robust particle at the heart of ordinary matter.

In environments where the LCM is driven into unusually high
compression—such as planetary interiors or other steep-gradient
regions—the internal modes of matter respond in predictable ways.
Under these conditions, the lag-mode naturally contracts into a
proton-like state, while the lead-mode remains electron-like, creating a
straightforward pathway for hydrogen to form as a stable product of
extreme compression.

This mechanism preserves charge balance and operates independently of
any primordial supply of material. A discussion of why this remains
feasible even when naïve density estimates might suggest otherwise, and
how it shapes the evolution of planets and moons, is presented in [Earth
and the Solar System](#earth-and-the-solar-system).

## Why the Proton Remains Compressed in Low-Density LCM

Once the lag-mode standing wave undergoes secondary collapse and
reorganizes into the compact helical structure we identify as the
proton, the new configuration becomes profoundly self-stabilizing.
Unlike the positron-like lag-mode at ordinary densities, the proton is
not a surface-level feature of the LCM—it is a deeply concentrated
energy structure whose stability arises from continuous interaction
between the two media.

During collapse, the proton develops:

- **extremely high internal energy density**,

- a **very strong GCM shadow**, and

- a **steep LCM compression field** tightly wrapped around the standing
  wave.

These features do not depend on the external LCM environment. They arise
from the proton's **own geometry and GCM opacity**, which together
create a self-reinforcing pocket of compressed LCM. Even if the proton
moves from a dense LCM environment (where it formed) into a low-density
region (such as surface matter or vacuum), it does **not** decompress.

The reason is that the GCM flux is pervasive and uninterrupted
everywhere:

- The proton's concentrated energy produces a large GCM shadow.

- That shadow produces continuous inward momentum flux.

- The inward flux maintains the LCM compression well around the proton.

- The compression well locks the standing wave into its compact
  geometry.

Nothing about this mechanism relies on high ambient LCM density. Once
established, the proton's internal feedback loop keeps it stable:

1.  **High energy density → high GCM opacity**

2.  **High opacity → strong inward GCM momentum flux**

3.  **Inward flux → tightly compressed LCM**

4.  **Tight compression → stability of the standing-wave geometry**

To appreciate how dramatic this stability is, compare the proton's
internal density to ordinary matter. A typical rock has a density of
about 3,000 kg/m<sup>3</sup>, whereas the implied energy density inside a proton
is roughly 10<sup>1</sup><sup>7</sup> kg/m<sup>3</sup> — fourteen orders of magnitude higher.
Even white dwarf material (\~10<sup>9</sup> kg/m<sup>3</sup>) and neutron star crusts
(\~10<sup>1</sup><sup>4</sup> kg/m<sup>3</sup>) fall far below this level. From the proton's
perspective, every macroscopic environment — rock, air, vacuum — is
effectively *dilute*.

This also clarifies why gravity *seems* negligible at atomic scales. On
macroscopic scales, a proton's total mass is tiny, so its gravitational
pull appears insignificant. But what matters in 2MM is not total
mass—it is **energy density**. The proton concentrates a staggering
amount of energy into an extremely small region, creating an **intensely
focused GCM shadow** right around itself. This produces a strong local
inward momentum flux, even though the long-range gravitational effect is
small. The proton's own geometry makes this inward flux sharply confined
and exceptionally strong. This locally intense field is also what
ultimately contributes to short-range nuclear binding—the beginnings
of the strong force—which will be developed in a later section.

In this light, the proton's stability becomes intuitive. It is a tightly
bound, ultra-dense collapsed mode, sustained by continuous reinforcement
between the LCM compression field and the GCM momentum flux. The
everyday world simply does not have the capacity to disturb it.

## The Neutron: A Paired Standing-Wave Structure

With the proton and electron understood as distinct helical
standing-wave modes stabilized by GCM confinement, the neutron can be
viewed not as a fundamentally separate particle but as a paired
configuration of these two modes. In the Two-Medium Model, a neutron
forms when a lead-mode (electron-like) oscillation and a lag-mode
(proton-precursor) oscillation become phase-locked within a shared
compression well.

In this combined state, the opposite chiral tendencies of the two modes
partially cancel, producing a geometry that is neither fully lead-mode
nor fully lag-mode. The resulting LCM compression profile is gentler
than that of a solitary proton: the concentrated lag-mode structure
alone generates an extremely steep compression gradient, but the paired
configuration spreads energy over a wider region. This yields a particle
that interacts gravitationally like a proton yet lacks the sharp
electrostatic signature of either charge.

Unlike the proton, whose extreme density allows it to remain compact in
any environment, the neutron's stability depends on its surroundings.
Inside nuclei, overlapping GCM shadows and elevated LCM densities
provide a supportive background that reinforces the shared compression
well, allowing the paired modes to remain coherent. Outside the nucleus,
ambient LCM density is too low to maintain the combined structure. The
compression well weakens, the two modes separate, and the system relaxes
into its components: a proton-like collapsed lag-mode, an electron-like
lead-mode, and a brief outward fluctuation in the LCM—observed as a
neutrino-like disturbance. No standalone decay particle is required; the
"neutrino" is simply the outward redistribution of oscillatory energy
released as the paired state breaks apart.

The neutron is heavier than a proton because it confines energy from
both helical modes, yet it is less compact. The interference between
their compression patterns limits how tightly either mode can draw in
the surrounding LCM. The result is a particle with high internal energy
but a shallower confinement profile—one that relies on nuclear
environments for long-term stability. This reduced confinement plays a
central role in nuclear structure, influencing why neutrons stabilize
nuclei, how they arrange in characteristic ratios, and why only certain
isotopes are viable.

# Interactions: How Forces Arise from the Two Media

With the structure of matter established, the next step is to understand
how matter **interacts**. In 2MM, there are no separate "fundamental
forces" in the conventional sense. All interactions—electrostatic,
magnetic, nuclear, and gravitational—arise from the same underlying
mechanism: the way **LCM compression fields** and **GCM momentum flux**
respond to the presence, motion, and geometry of standing-wave
particles.

Every particle creates a characteristic distortion in the LCM, shaped by
its internal oscillation pattern and maintained by its GCM shadow. When
particles approach one another, these distortions overlap, reinforce, or
interfere in predictable ways. The GCM flux responds to these
distortions as well, altering the inward or outward momentum transfer
between the two media. What we interpret as "forces" are simply **the
adjustments required for the two media to maintain equilibrium while
accommodating multiple standing waves in close proximity**.

This framework removes the need to postulate separate fundamental
interactions. Instead:

- **Electrostatic forces** arise from how LCM compression fields overlap
  or oppose each other.

- **Magnetic forces** arise from interactions between torsional
  components of standing waves and the relative motion of their
  compression fields.

- **Nuclear forces** emerge from extreme GCM shadowing and the resulting
  high-pressure compression wells at very short range.

- **Gravity** is the macroscopic result of accumulated GCM shadowing
  from many particles acting in concert.

By tracing all interactions back to a single mechanism—the dynamic
cooperation between LCM elasticity and GCM flux—2MM provides a unified
physical origin for force behavior across all scales. In this sense, the
model does not contain multiple independent forces at all. **Every
interaction reduces to a single kind of physical event: an inelastic
momentum exchange between the two media.** What appear to us as distinct
forces are simply different geometric outcomes of how particles and
their compression fields shape, redirect, or obstruct the continual
movement of the GCM through the LCM.

## Electrostatic Forces: Compression Geometry and GCM Support

Electrostatic behavior emerges naturally once particles are understood
as localized distortions in the LCM. Each charged particle produces a
characteristic **LCM compression field**, shaped by the geometry of its
standing-wave mode and maintained by its GCM shadow. When two such
fields approach one another, they must fit together in a way that
preserves equilibrium in both media. The ease or difficulty of this fit
determines whether the interaction is repulsive or attractive.

**Like charges repel** because their compression fields have similar
shapes and orientations. Bringing them together requires forcing two
incompatible LCM geometries to overlap, which creates steep gradients
and increases local compression. The LCM responds by pushing the
particles apart—the same way two stiff springs resist being pressed
into one another. GCM effects play a secondary role here: because each
particle's shadow is shaped by its own compression field, bringing like
charges together does not create a deeper combined shadow. The GCM
contributes insufficient inward pull, leaving the LCM's geometric
incompatibility to dominate and drive the particles apart.

**Opposite charges attract** for the complementary reason. Their
compression fields have opposite orientations, allowing them to
interlock smoothly. The combined field has lower overall distortion than
either field alone, creating a more stable configuration. The GCM flux
enhances this by forming a deeper, more coherent shadow around the pair,
increasing the inward momentum transfer and gently pulling them
together.

In 2MM, electrostatic forces are therefore not "generated" by the LCM or
the GCM in isolation. They arise from the **balance between LCM
deformation and GCM pressure**, with compression-field geometry
providing the dominant mechanism and the GCM flux supplying the
continual momentum exchange that maintains the equilibrium.

It is also worth noting that, at these scales, the **local gravitational
attraction** between two extremely dense standing waves—though small
on macroscopic scales—may be more significant than traditionally
assumed. The relative contribution of this short-range GCM-driven
attraction remains an open question and will require a more detailed
mathematical treatment. What matters for now is that electrostatic
forces need no separate postulate: they follow directly from how the two
media respond when compression fields overlap.

## Magnetic Forces: Torsion, Motion, and Collective Alignment

Magnetic behavior in 2MM follows directly from the **torsional
component** of the electron's helical standing-wave structure. Even when
an electron is stationary, its dual-mode oscillations twist the
surrounding LCM into a subtle helical pattern. This built-in torsion
acts as an **intrinsic magnetic dipole**, a tiny directional feature of
the electron's compression field. Because the helical mode has a
handedness, the dipole has a preferred orientation, and nearby LCM
reacts differently depending on how the dipole is aligned.

When an electron moves through the LCM, the torsional field surrounding
it is carried along and becomes slightly skewed. The LCM does not flow
uniformly around the electron's helix: one side encounters greater
torsional resistance, while the other side relaxes. The GCM flux also
participates in this asymmetry, exchanging momentum differently across
the distorted compression field. Together, these effects produce a
**torque** that tends to align the electron's intrinsic dipole with its
motion—much like a spinning object aligning in a flowing fluid, except
that the mechanism here is mediated by LCM shear and GCM shadowing
rather than hydrodynamic drag. This alignment tendency is the
microscopic origin of magnetic behavior in moving charges.

When many electrons move together—as in an electric current—their
individual dipoles become biased toward a common orientation. Each
electron contributes a small skewing of the LCM torsional field, and
together these skewings add up to a coherent **shear pattern**
encircling the flow. The GCM flux reinforces this pattern by responding
to the collective distortion of the LCM, producing a stable macroscopic
field around the current. The familiar circular magnetic field around a
wire is therefore the large-scale imprint of countless aligned
microscopic helices, all interacting with the two media in the same
direction.

A different form of alignment appears in ferromagnetic materials. Here,
electrons do not need to move through the LCM to align their dipoles.
Instead, lattice geometry and energetic constraints encourage certain
orientations of the intrinsic helical mode. In regions where the lattice
allows these orientations to lock together, the torsional fields of many
electrons become mutually reinforcing. Their compression and shear
patterns combine into a persistent macroscopic field even in the absence
of current. Ferromagnetism, then, is simply the **static alignment** of
many intrinsic dipoles, whereas current magnetism is the **dynamic
alignment** produced by motion.

#### Helicity as a Natural Outcome of Wave Collapse

It is worth stepping back to recall why the helical standing-wave
structure appeared in the first place. It was not assumed—it emerged
by imposing a small set of physical requirements on how a high-frequency
transverse wave must collapse when forming a pair of opposite particles.
The collapse must: **(1)** produce two structures with equal energy but
opposite chirality, **(2)** preserve the symmetry of the original wave,
**(3)** generate stable standing waves supported by both the LCM and the
GCM, and **(4)** provide a natural geometric distinction between the two
modes. A dual-oscillation helical structure is the simplest
configuration that satisfies all of these constraints.

What makes this especially compelling is that the structure is **not ad
hoc**—the universe already reveals the same geometry on macroscopic
scales. When electrical currents flow freely through a plasma,
unconstrained by solid conductors, they spontaneously organize into
**helical, filamentary structures**. This large-scale behavior mirrors
the microscopic torsional patterns predicted for individual charge
carriers. The fact that plasmas naturally adopt helical geometries
strengthens the case that helicity is not an arbitrary choice in 2MM but
a recurring, scale-independent feature of how the two media prefer to
arrange flowing energy.

## Nuclear Structure: Why Only Proton–Neutron Pairs Bind

In 2MM, nuclear binding arises from the same interplay of LCM
compression fields and GCM shadowing that governs all other
interactions. What makes nuclei special is simply the **scale**:
particles must approach closely enough that their GCM shadows overlap
strongly while their LCM compression fields remain geometrically
compatible. Only one pairing—proton with neutron—achieves this
balance.

Protons resist close approach because their LCM compression fields are
extraordinarily steep and tightly wound. Pushing two protons together
forces their sharply peaked gradients to overlap, creating enormous
repulsive pressure long before their centers can approach the distance
required for strong GCM shadowing. Even though GCM provides an inward
momentum flux, the repulsion between two proton compression fields grows
much faster than the gravitational-like attraction. The result is
unavoidable: **proton–proton pairs cannot bind**, even if forced
together. Repulsion wins at every relevant scale.

Neutrons behave differently, but no more favorably for forming pairs.
Their compression fields are broader and softer, owing to their larger
and less compact standing-wave structure. This reduces both the
repulsion between two neutrons and the strength of their GCM shadowing.
Neither effect wins decisively. The repulsion is weaker than between
protons, but the attraction is weaker still, so the two neutrons can
never be brought close enough for the GCM flux to dominate. The outcome
is the same as for protons: **neutron–neutron pairs do not form stable
bonds**.

The proton–neutron pair is the exception because their complementary
structures allow them to approach one another more closely and more
comfortably than like–like pairs. The proton's compact core can slip
deeper into the neutron's softer compression field without encountering
the catastrophic repulsion that would occur between two protons. This
closer separation creates dramatically stronger GCM shadowing between
their centers—far stronger than in either like–like case—because
shadow strength increases steeply with decreasing distance.

At the same time, the neutron's gentle compression gradient helps buffer
the proton's sharpest LCM features. The two fields can merge into a
configuration with **lower total deformation** than either particle
could achieve with a like partner. The neutron essentially absorbs some
of the proton's steep curvature while presenting little of its own. This
synergy allows the inward GCM momentum flux to outpace the rising LCM
repulsion, producing a genuine energy minimum—a bound nuclear state.

In this view, the familiar "strong force" does not require a separate
mechanism. It is simply the extreme end of the same balance between LCM
compression and GCM shadowing that governs all interactions, made
visible only when particles are pushed to distances where their
compression fields and shadows interact at their steepest gradients. A
proton–neutron pair is the only configuration that satisfies this
balance. All nuclear structure—from deuterium to the heavy
elements—emerges from combinations of these paired interactions and
their geometric constraints.

## Gravity: Long-Range GCM Shadowing and the Resolution of the Heat Crisis

In 2MM, gravity arises from **GCM shadowing**. Every standing
wave—proton, neutron, or electron—interacts inelastically with the
background GCM flux, reducing its intensity in the region directly
behind it. When two masses face one another, each sits inside the
other's reduced-flux region and therefore receives slightly more inward
momentum from the opposite side. The imbalance produces a **net inward
push** that we interpret as gravitational attraction. On macroscopic
scales, what we call "gravity" is simply the accumulated effect of
countless such shadow interactions, structured by the LCM fields of the
matter involved.

The classical LeSage picture runs into trouble because it treats matter
as a rigid target being bombarded by a high-speed background, which
would quickly drive everything to unphysical temperatures. In 2MM,
particles are not solid absorbers; they are **standing waves** in the
LCM, confined by a balance between outward LCM elasticity and inward GCM
momentum. The GCM flux continuously supplies energy and momentum to
these structures. A significant fraction of that input is spent simply
on maintaining the compressed standing-wave configuration, while the
rest can appear as internal excitations or as kinetic energy of the
particle as a whole. In this sense, GCM interactions do contribute to
kinetic particle energy (i.e., heating) to the extent one would expect
from their momentum transfer. The standing-wave structure provides a
robust channel for absorbing and redistributing energy rather than
allowing it to accumulate uncontrollably in purely translational motion.

At planetary scales, GCM interactions are therefore still expected to
contribute *some* but not *all* of their energy to internal heating. In
dense interiors, where LCM compression is high, wave collapse and
lag-mode collapse can occur, forming new protons and electrons. The
creation of new standing waves **consumes energy**, converting part of
the gravitational power input into rest mass instead of heat. Over
geological timescales, this matter-creation channel acts as an
additional energy sink. 2MM does not claim that GCM-induced heating
disappears; rather, it proposes that some of that energy is continually
diverted into building and maintaining structure, including the gradual
addition of new matter in the deepest regions of massive bodies.

A natural question arises here: **are planetary interiors really dense
enough to push LCM compression toward the thresholds required for wave
collapse and matter creation?** This section only outlines the
conceptual mechanism. The next section, [Earth and the Solar
System](#earth-and-the-solar-system), examines the planetary context
more closely.

To conclude, gravity in 2MM is not a separate fundamental force but the
**macroscopic expression of GCM shadowing**, always shaped by the LCM
structures of matter. The heat crisis is avoided because both particles
and planets have built-in channels for GCM momentum to become
**organized structure**—stable standing waves and new matter—rather
than accumulating as unbounded thermal energy.

# Earth and the Solar System

The idea that Earth's radius may have changed over geological time has
appeared in many forms throughout the history of geophysics. Although it
sits outside the modern mainstream, it has been examined seriously by
researchers such as Samuel Warren Carey, who viewed expansion as a
possible unifying framework for continental drift, and Dr. James Maxlow,
who produced detailed reconstructions suggesting smaller ancient Earth
radii. A full discussion of the evidence and counter-arguments is beyond
the scope of this paper; readers interested in the broader debate are
encouraged to consult those primary works.

What matters for 2MM is not the historical argument itself, but the
striking fact that the model approaches the possibility of planetary
growth from a completely different direction. Rather than beginning with
geological interpretation, 2MM arrives at the idea through the internal
physics of the LCM. Under sustained high compression, the model predicts
that LCM-wave collapse and proton formation act as a continuous energy
sink in planetary interiors, naturally introducing slow mass increase
over geological timescales.

One of the long-standing obstacles for expansion hypotheses has been the
absence of a physically grounded mechanism capable of driving sustained
planetary growth. 2MM does not claim to resolve the entire geological
debate, but it does offer a plausible mechanism where none previously
existed—providing a fresh context in which expansion models can be
reconsidered.

## A Coherent Interior: How 2MM Reinterprets the Earth From the Inside Out

One of the simplest ways to challenge any new physical framework is to
ask what it predicts for something we know well. The Earth—warm,
magnetic, geologically active—provides a natural test case. If the
Two-Medium Model (2MM) were merely a reinterpretation of known physics,
its implications for planetary interiors would collapse back into the
familiar. But if it is a genuinely different ontology, the model should
produce a meaningfully different and internally coherent picture of what
happens beneath our feet.

The interesting thing is that it does.

It begins innocently enough: a naïve calculation of LCM density inside
the Earth. Using conventional estimates—nuclear spacings, bulk
density, gravitational potential—nothing unusual emerges. The interior
looks too dilute, in LCM terms, to support anything exotic. Nuclear
compression envelopes barely overlap, and the gravitational potential
difference from surface to core barely nudges photon energies. Under
that view, the LCM is a placid background medium with no special role in
planetary interiors.

But in 2MM, this quiet interior is a mirage. Gravity is not geometric
curvature but a consequence of a perpetual LeSage-style flux (the GCM),
pumping kinetic energy into matter and into the LCM itself. Matter is
not pointlike but a superposition of compressive and torsional standing
waves with two distinct modes—lag and lead—that respond differently
to background LCM density. And the interior is not a static solid but a
conducting, liquid-like plasma, threaded by currents and stabilized by
the very structure of the LCM.

When these ingredients are considered together, a strikingly
different—and surprisingly plausible—picture of the Earth emerges.

### A dynamical interior shaped by a universal energy flux

In 2MM, the Earth's heat is not the remnant of primordial formation or
radioactive decay alone. It is continually refreshed by GCM impacts:
non-elastic, microscopic collisions that nudge nuclei, heat the
interior, and feed the slow churning of the liquid outer core. This is
not heat in the usual thermodynamic sense, but the steady background hum
of the universe's gravitational engine.

These impacts increase the frequency of high-energy close encounters
between nuclei. Though brief, these moments produce intense local LCM
compression far beyond the ambient level. What looks like a soft
interior when averaged hides countless microregions where the LCM is
stressed to its limits. It is in these transient events that the model's
distinctive physics—LCM-wave collapse, pair creation, proton
formation—can occur at meaningful rates.

### A confined, liquid plasma capable of self-organizing structures

At depth, the Earth's material is not a gaseous plasma but a dense,
viscous, electrically conducting liquid. In such a medium, currents do
not wander diffusely—they self-organize. Magnetic fields draw current
channels inward, forming pinched filaments embedded within the
surrounding liquid. These z-pinch–like structures behave as LCM
compression hotspots: narrow, persistent sites where matter is denser,
currents are stronger, and the LCM is driven into non-linear regimes.

This picture resonates quietly with the geomagnetic field. A network of
conductive filaments in a churning plasma shell naturally produces
strong, long-lived magnetic fields. It accommodates the irregular and
chaotic reversals seen in the paleomagnetic record. And it does so
without requiring fine-tuning; the GCM ensures a continuous power
source, and the liquid plasma ensures the necessary fluidity.

### Lag and lead modes: structure shaped by density

The lag-mode (positron-like) and lead-mode (electron-like) behave
differently in strong LCM gradients due to their internal phase
relationships. Lag-mode structures, whose compressive oscillation lags
behind the torsion, are stabilized in dense LCM environments—they
"lock in" to the high-compression background. Lead-mode structures are
the opposite: their compressive phase leads the torsional motion, and
this configuration naturally tends to move away from strongly compressed
regions.

The outcome is a subtle but powerful radial sorting:

- **Lag-mode matter sinks toward the deep core**, enriching it in
  protons and related composites.

- **Lead-mode matter preferentially resides in outer regions**, where it
  increases electrical conductivity and supports the dynamo.

This sorting sharpens LCM density gradients and reinforces the
interior's layered behavior. The Earth becomes a self-organized system
where composition, conductivity, and compression structure naturally
arise from basic mode dynamics.

### Hydrogen: a bridge between deep physics and surface evolution

If 2MM is correct, high-compression regions should generate hydrogen
from LCM-wave breakdown. Hydrogen introduced into a silicate melt does
not float to the surface; it dissolves into minerals, forms hydroxyl,
shifts redox balances, and increases conductivity. Over geologic time,
as hydrogen binds to oxygen, the deep interior becomes a slow factory of
water.

This creates an intriguing link with geological evidence. Much of
Earth's early continental crust was covered by shallow seas; later eras
saw repeated widespread flooding of continental interiors. Standard
models explain these largely through tectonics and sea-level cycles, but
2MM adds an additional long-term trend: the gradual accumulation of
interior-generated water and the slow outward expression of that water
through volcanism, mantle degassing, and mineral dehydration.

As the Earth grows in mass and radius—consistent with the
interpretations of Maxlow, Carey, and others—new ocean basins form,
continents separate, and water cycles between interior and surface
reshape the geography of the planet.

### What emerges

Put together, these ideas give the Earth a new conceptual coherence
under 2MM:

- A **deep interior continually energized** by the gravitational flux.

- A **liquid plasma shell threaded with current filaments**, producing
  magnetic fields and reversals as emergent behavior.

- A **mode-stratified structure** in which lag and lead components find
  their natural energetic niches.

- A **chemical pathway** from deep LCM processes to surface hydrology.

- And a **slow increase in planetary mass and volume**, offering an
  ontological foundation for Earth-expansion interpretations previously
  considered speculative.

None of these claims, on their own, prove 2MM. But together they sketch
a world that is internally consistent, physically motivated, and rich
with testable implications. The model does not ask specialists to
discard their data—only to look again, from a new angle, at patterns
that were already there.

For an ontological theory, that is exactly the kind of foothold one
hopes to achieve.

## A Solar System Reinterpreted Through 2MM

If the Two-Medium Model offers a genuine ontology of matter and
gravity—an account of how the universe operates at its most
fundamental level—then it should not merely reproduce familiar
planetary structures. It should reveal new patterns in the Solar System
that seem incidental under mainstream theories but become natural, even
expected, in a universe built of interacting LCM and GCM media. When 2MM
is applied beyond Earth, that is precisely what begins to happen.

In conventional astrophysics, the Solar System's planets are divided
into primordial categories: rocky inner planets formed from refractory
dust near the Sun, while gas giants accumulated cold hydrogen and helium
farther out during the nebular collapse. Water-ice worlds are assigned
to the outer system simply because the frost line stood there at the
time of formation. This picture is tidy, but also fragile: it relies on
a single snapshot of early solar conditions and presumes that bulk
compositions are frozen relics from four and a half billion years ago.

The 2MM picture is more dynamic and in many ways more organic. Matter is
not fixed at the moment of planetary birth; it is continuously produced
in the interiors of heavy bodies through LCM-wave collapse and proton
formation. And critically, the matter most easily synthesized—because
it is the simplest condensed lag-mode structure—is **hydrogen**. In
2MM, hydrogen is not merely a leftover from the solar nebula; it is the
natural basal product of matter creation in any world where the LCM is
sufficiently compressed. A rocky planet, given enough time and
sufficient mass, would gradually enrich itself in hydrogen and evolve
toward the composition of a gas giant. Instead of gas giants being
primordial anomalies, they become the expected endpoints of planetary
growth under a universal, continuing physical process.

Jupiter, then, is less a frozen accident of formation than a world that
has simply had more time and mass to accumulate the dominant product of
the 2MM engine. Its vast LCM-well stabilizes hydrogen in increasingly
exotic configurations, thinning into molecular layers above and
compressing into metallic hydrogen in its depths. The metallic hydrogen
is not an exotic material conjured only by high pressure; it is the
expression of lag-mode structures settling into their natural
configuration under extreme background compression. With it comes
immense conductivity, wrapped into a self-organizing fluid shell,
generating a magnetic field so powerful that it leaves an imprint
throughout the Jovian system.

But the story grows more interesting when we consider the moons. In the
traditional view, the ice-rich moons of Jupiter and Saturn are remnants
of volatile-rich planetesimals that happened to form beyond the frost
line. In 2MM, their watery compositions take on a different
significance. Hydrogen created in the interiors of large planets and
emitted through volcanic, tidal, or plasma pathways finds oxygen
wherever it can. In silicate systems, oxygen is ubiquitous. Hydrogen
does what it always does: it binds, dissolves, hydrates, reduces, and
ultimately forms water. Water is not a leftover; it is a **natural
chemical consequence** of hydrogen synthesis in oxygen-bearing
environments.

A moon embedded in a giant planet's LCM envelope does not orbit inertly.
It experiences a raised baseline LCM compression, because it is immersed
in the extended compression field of the host. For a world like Europa
or Enceladus, this changes everything. The threshold for LCM-wave
breakdown drops; interior heating becomes more efficient; and hydrogen
produced in core or mantle regions chemically transforms the body over
time. The icy shells and global oceans that dominate these moons are
precisely what one would expect in a system where hydrogen emerges
continually and encounters oxygen-rich rocks and minerals awaiting
hydration.

Even Io—the most volcanically active object known—finds a natural
place in this narrative. Its extreme activity is usually ascribed purely
to tidal flexing. But under 2MM, Io occupies the deepest region of
Jupiter's compressed LCM environment. Its interior is perpetually
stirred by both tidal motions and a highly modulated GCM flux. Every
compression cycle strengthens the probability of LCM-wave collapse
events; every temperature rise increases the frequency of nuclear
close-approaches. The result is a world in which volcanism is not merely
an effect of tides but a structural outcome of living within Jupiter's
gravitational energy field.

In this broader view, the Solar System becomes a hierarchy of LCM
environments nested within one another. Each planet and moon does not
simply hold material inherited from the past but actively grows,
differentiates, and reconfigures itself according to its position in the
LCM landscape. The giant planets are hydrogen-rich not because they
captured nebular gas more effectively, but because hydrogen is the
universe's simplest and most abundant emergent product. The icy moons
possess vast reservoirs of water not because they formed in a cold
region, but because hydrogen naturally synthesizes and water is the
simplest outcome when hydrogen meets oxygen under pressure. And
volcanically active worlds like Io are not oddities but inevitable
consequences of immersion in high-compression LCM fields.

What 2MM offers here is not a replacement for the observed Solar System,
but a **reinterpretation that unifies its diversity**. It suggests that
the features we see—metallic hydrogen, buried oceans, volcanic
extremes—are not historical accidents but emergent phenomena of a
deeper ontology. The planets become active participants in a universal
process of matter creation and LCM structuring, and the Solar System
becomes a laboratory where this process can be read directly in the
worlds themselves.

For specialists, this perspective does not demand immediate belief. What
it offers is coherence: a conceptual framework in which many of the
Solar System's most puzzling features fall into place with surprising
ease. Such coherence is often the first sign that a theory is worth a
closer look.

## Earth and Venus: Divergent Paths in a Growing-Planet Framework

Earth and Venus are often described as planetary twins—similar in
size, density, and overall composition. Yet their geological histories
could not be more different. From a 2MM perspective, this divergence
centers not on initial conditions, but on how each planet's crust
responds to the slow accumulation of internally generated matter.

Venus, for all its volcanic vigor, remains a planet with a **closed
lithosphere**. It does display impressive rift-like structures—long
extensional troughs such as Devana Chasma and the chasmata of Aphrodite
Terra. But these features, striking as they are, do *not* organize into
a global network. They do not segment the crust into distinct plates,
establish coherent spreading centers, or create a conveyor system for
renewing the planetary surface. They are fractures, not gateways.
Extension happens, but it never matures into a mechanism that opens the
lithosphere and relocates older crust laterally.

With no global rift system and no subduction, Venus cannot expand its
surface area in a steady fashion. Any material created internally,
whether by conventional processes or—under 2MM—by compression-driven
hydrogen synthesis, has only one meaningful escape route: **episodic
volcanism**. But volcanism deposits new material *on top of* the old
crust, thickening and stressing it rather than relieving internal
pressure. Over time, heat and strain build until the lithosphere yields
catastrophically. This offers a coherent explanation for Venus's
globally young surface and its evidence for planet-scale resurfacing
events: a world periodically forced to reset because it has no
continuous outlet for its internal growth.

Earth, by contrast, eventually broke through its Venus-like stage. Its
most ancient crust—thick, buoyant, and granitic—forms the
continents. But surrounding that is a very different crust: thin, mafic,
and universally young. This two-layered architecture tells a story.
Before \~200 million years ago, Earth may have resembled Venus
structurally, with a unified supercontinent draped across a smaller
globe and no global rift network. Matter created within the planet,
whether from thermal sources or the deeper processes described in 2MM,
could escape only through massive volcanic events.

And the fossil record agrees. The pre-200-million-year interval is
marked by major mass extinctions tied to enormous flood basalts—the
Siberian Traps, the Central Atlantic Magmatic Province, the Viluy Traps,
and others. These events look like the signatures of a planet straining
against a closed shell.

But around the Triassic–Jurassic boundary, Earth cracked. Long, linear
rifts connected into a global system. The first true spreading zones
opened. Oceanic crust began forming continuously at ridges and migrating
outward. For the first time, Earth acquired a **permanent
pressure-release mechanism**. New material was added at the base of
fresh crust, not dumped on top of ancient layers. Old crust drifted away
rather than thickening in place.

This transition—from eruptions as the only outlet to a steady, global
rifting mechanism—marks a fundamental difference between the two
sister planets. Venus today remains in the earlier, closed-lithosphere
regime. Earth moved into an open-lithosphere regime that can adapt to
internal growth rather than rupture under it.

In 2MM terms, Earth and Venus become two snapshots of how planets
respond to internal LCM-driven evolution. Venus shows what happens when
matter creation pressures build beneath a lithosphere that never fully
opens. Earth shows what becomes possible when rifting matures into a
global architecture of renewal.

And that divergence—rooted not in their origins but in their
structural responses—goes a long way toward explaining why one world
is catastrophically resurfaced and shrouded in volcanic heat, while the
other carries a stable hydrosphere, a biosphere, and a geological record
stretching back billions of years.

## Water as the Signature of Planetary Maturity in 2MM

If there is a single element that bridges geology, chemistry, and
biology, it is water. In the standard cosmological model, water is
treated as an accident of formation—an inheritance from icy
planetesimals delivered during accretion or bombardment. Its presence
depends sensitively on where a planet forms, how much ice it captures,
and whether volatile materials survive the violence of early impacts.
Most of the time, water is treated as a historical contingency rather
than a physical necessity.

In the Two-Medium Model, this premise shifts dramatically. Water is no
longer an accident of origin; it is a **natural byproduct of planetary
evolution**.

Because matter creation in 2MM proceeds through LCM-wave breakdown, the
simplest and most frequently produced matter is hydrogen. And since
oxygen is one of the most abundant elements in rocky material, any
significant production of hydrogen inside a silicate planet will
inevitably find oxygen to bond with. The encounter is almost chemically
predetermined: hydrogen dissolves into silicate minerals, reduces iron,
forms hydroxyl groups, and eventually stabilizes as water.

Under this view, a planet of sufficient mass and internal LCM
compression does not *inherit* its water—it **manufactures** it.

This is a profound difference. It means that water is not something rare
or fragile; it is the natural chemical expression of lag-mode matter
creation interacting with an oxygen-bearing crust. On Earth, this
process has quietly operated for billions of years, supplementing
primordial water with deep-sourced hydrogen that emerges through
volcanism, mantle degassing, and metamorphic cycles. Seen through this
lens, Earth's oceans are not simply remnants of cosmic delivery—they
are, at least in part, the long-term outcome of its internal LCM
dynamics.

Once this principle is in place, the Solar System begins to look very
different.

Icy moons—Europa, Enceladus, Ganymede, Titan—are no longer puzzles
or exceptions. They are precisely what one expects for worlds embedded
in the deep LCM wells of giant planets. Their internal heat, driven by a
combination of tidal forcing and GCM flux, maintains vast liquid oceans
beneath their icy crusts. And their water inventory, rather than being
relics of formation beyond the frost line, may reflect the slow
accumulation of H$_2$O generated inside them through the same
hydrogen–oxygen chemistry that shapes Earth.

Even the location of these moons, far outside the classical "goldilocks
zone," ceases to be a constraint. Surface sunlight is irrelevant. What
matters is internal compression, LCM gradients, and the ongoing energy
input from the gravitational medium. If a moon can maintain a dense,
conductive interior—either by size, composition, or proximity to a
giant planet—then liquid water becomes not exceptional but expected.

And if water is expected, then so is **habitability** in a broad
thermodynamic sense. 2MM does not claim that life must arise wherever
water appears; that would overreach. But it does shift the landscape of
probabilities. Instead of a universe with only a few rare islands inside
narrow temperature bands around stars, 2MM suggests a universe in which
water may form within a wide range of planetary contexts, and liquid
oceans may persist even where starlight cannot reach.

This expanded view does not guarantee life elsewhere—it simply makes
the question more open. It nudges the expectation away from rarity and
toward a universe where planets and moons, by virtue of their internal
physics, cultivate water as a fundamental outcome of their growth. In
that sense, the Two-Medium Model reframes one of the oldest questions in
astronomy. The significance of water is not that it is rare, but that it
is a natural signature of a mature planet—a world that has crossed the
threshold where LCM compression, matter creation, and basic chemistry
collaborate.

If this picture is even partly correct, then the Solar System is not an
anomaly. It is a template. And worlds like ours—wet, layered,
internally dynamic—may be far more common than our current models
allow.

## Related Works

Many of the ideas related to Earth expansion discussed here are not
original to this work. What is significant in the context of 2MM is that
the model provides a physical mechanism—developed independently of the
expanding-Earth framework—that naturally leads to predictions about
which bodies in the Solar System should experience long-term growth
through internal hydrogen production. Readers interested in the broader
geological and historical arguments for planetary expansion may wish to
begin with the works of Dr. James Maxlow and Professor Samuel Warren
Carey, both of whom have explored this topic extensively from a
geological perspective.

The work of Stephen Hurrell is especially noteworthy because it
approaches the expansion question from a completely different direction.
Rather than beginning with geological reconstructions, Hurrell examined
the biomechanics and scaling limits of ancient organisms, concluding
that Earth's surface gravity must have been significantly weaker in the
past. This implies not merely a smaller planetary radius, but a smaller
planetary mass—a crucial distinction, because it separates two
fundamentally different expansion models. A radius-only expansion
(constant mass) would produce stronger gravity in the past, whereas
Hurrell's findings point toward an expansion driven by increasing mass
over time. This independent line of evidence aligns more closely with
frameworks—such as 2MM—that allow for internal matter generation
rather than geometric inflation alone.

# Cosmology in an Infinite Medium

## Momentum Flow

In the Two-Medium Model, gravity is produced by the flow of ultra-fast
particles in the GCM pushing on patterns in the slower LCM. For this
mechanism to work, the two media must exchange momentum in a way that
depends on the local state of the LCM. Early versions of the model
assumed that the momentum transfer switched direction depending on
whether the region was a cluster or a void. That assumption turned out
to be incorrect: galaxies exist inside voids, which means matter remains
stable there, and so the rule could not depend purely on location. The
model was updated accordingly.

The required sign flip is now tied to the **form of the LCM wave**, not
to where the wave is located. The LCM supports two kinds of deformation:
a **compression component**, which squeezes the medium, and a **torsion
component**, which twists it. Light and matter both use these same two
components, but in different proportions.

**Traveling waves** (light) need to move long distances without being
scattered. They naturally evolve into a form dominated by **torsion**,
which interacts only weakly with the GCM. When a GCM particle passes
through this diffuse, torsion-heavy background, it receives tiny, random
momentum kicks. Individually these kicks are small, but over long
distances—such as the interior of a cosmic void—they add up to a
slight **net gain of momentum for the GCM**. This is the recharge
process that makes voids high-flux regions.

**Standing waves** (matter), on the other hand, need to stay in one
place and resist spreading out. To do this, they must create a strong
local disturbance in the LCM. This requires the compression component to
dominate. A standing wave with strong compression presents a large
"impedance" to the GCM: when a GCM particle strikes it, the GCM loses
momentum efficiently. This loss is what creates the directional
depletion, or "shadow," that holds the standing wave together and makes
matter stable.

With this picture in mind, the sign flip becomes natural:

- **Compression-dominated LCM (matter)** extracts momentum from the GCM.

- **Torsion-dominated LCM (diffuse radiation)** gives a small net
  momentum back to the GCM.

This is a property of the **wave state** of the LCM, not the cosmic
location. Void interiors happen to contain mostly diffuse,
torsion-dominated LCM waves, so they are strong recharge zones for the
GCM. Galaxies and other dense structures contain compression-dominated
standing waves, so they always extract momentum from the GCM, even when
placed inside a void.

This updated rule also resolves earlier contradictions. Since matter
always extracts momentum from the GCM, it remains stable everywhere,
including voids. And since voids predominantly contain torsion-type
waves, they naturally elevate the GCM flux, producing the repulsive
behavior that shapes the large-scale structure of the universe in 2MM.

## Cosmological Redshift

In this picture, saying that the GCM "gains momentum" in diffuse regions
is the same as saying that the LCM waves there slowly **lose** a tiny
amount of their own energy. For traveling waves like light, this gradual
loss appears as a slight reduction in frequency—a redshift. Over the
enormous distances between galaxies, these tiny losses accumulate. This
becomes the 2MM explanation for the cosmological redshift: light does
not stretch because space expands, but because it gives up a very small
amount of energy to the GCM as it travels.

A natural question is why this energy loss does **not** cause light to
scatter or blur, since it is exchanging momentum with the GCM along the
way. The reason is that the GCM particles are extremely small compared
to the structure of the LCM wave. Each interaction is just a tiny "tap,"
and most of the sideways taps cancel out because they come from all
directions equally. For every small nudge to one side, there is nearly
always another nudge in the opposite direction. The light wave therefore
keeps its direction and sharpness over vast distances.

## The CMB in an Infinite, Non-Expanding Universe

In the Two-Medium Model, the universe is infinite and filled with
countless sources of light: stars, galaxies, and all other standing-wave
structures that emit radiation. But unlike in an expanding-space
picture, light in 2MM does not stretch because space grows. Instead,
every traveling wave gradually **loses a tiny amount of energy** to the
GCM as it moves. Its frequency drops little by little, until eventually
it falls below the threshold of what we can detect. In an infinite
universe, this means that no matter how far you look, all of the distant
light has already "run down" into extremely low frequencies.

When you add together the contribution from every direction: light from
near sources, partially redshifted; light from further sources, heavily
redshifted; and light from extremely distant sources, redshifted almost
to nothing—you end up with a smooth background made of the
**accumulated leftovers** of all waves that have lost most of their
energy. Because this energy-loss process acts the same on all
wavelengths and happens uniformly throughout space, the combined
radiation naturally approaches a **blackbody spectrum**. A blackbody is
simply the most "relaxed" or "smeared-out" form that radiation can take
when its detailed structure has been erased, and that is exactly what
the long-term redshifting process produces.

This idea solves Olbers' paradox. The night sky is not bright, even in
an infinite universe, because every distant source has already faded far
down the frequency spectrum by the time its light reaches us. Instead of
a blinding sky, we see only the final, uniform glow of this accumulated
low-frequency tail. In 2MM, this glow is the cosmic microwave
background: the faint blackbody radiation produced by the infinite sum
of redshifted waves from all directions, reflecting the steady
running-down of light across the universe.

## Voids as Repulsive Regions

In the usual cosmological picture, voids are simply large empty regions
that expand faster than their surroundings. They do not actively push on
matter. Some modified-gravity theories have suggested otherwise,
proposing that voids might behave as if they were repulsive under
certain conditions. But these models introduce new fields or modify
gravity directly; none explain repulsion from the ground-up behavior of
a medium. In contrast, the Two-Medium Model arrives at repulsive voids
naturally by looking at how the two media exchange momentum.

The basic idea is simple. The GCM carries an extremely fast "flux" that
pushes on matter. Whenever this flux passes through a dense
region—like a galaxy, filament, or wall—it loses momentum because it
interacts with tightly packed LCM structures there. Over time, dense
regions drain and weaken the flux. But in a very empty region, like a
cosmic void, the opposite happens. The GCM rarely interacts with
anything and picks up a tiny amount of momentum from the loose LCM waves
that fill the void. Because these waves nudge the GCM from all
directions, sideways effects cancel out, but the small forward-moving
component builds up. This means the GCM becomes more energetic the
deeper it travels into a void.

It helps to visualize this as a kind of "elevation map" of flux
strength. Voids sit at the **high-elevation** end of the map, because
the GCM becomes most recharged there. Dense structures sit at the
**low-elevation** end, because they drain the GCM. Matter always feels a
push downhill on this map, away from high elevation and toward low
elevation. Since voids are the high points, the push is always outward.
This is the 2MM explanation for why voids act as repulsive regions:
matter is simply sliding downhill in the landscape shaped by the GCM
flux.

Real voids are not perfect spheres, so their "elevation map" is full of
ridges, plateaus, and valleys. The highest points lie farthest from all
surrounding structure. From these high points, many downhill paths lead
toward the walls that border the void. Matter inside a void behaves like
water on a tilted surface: it cannot climb toward the highest points and
instead flows along the downhill channels. As these channels converge
near the void walls, they produce small buildups of LCM density, which
is where matter is most likely to form or grow. This explains why void
centers remain nearly empty while galaxies cluster around the
boundaries.

## Galaxy Rotation Curves

This same elevation landscape in the GCM of voids also explains why
galaxies near voids often show rotation speeds that stay high far from
their centers. In regions dominated by normal structure, the GCM flux is
strongly depleted and behaves much like ordinary gravity, giving
familiar Newton-like force laws. But on the side of a galaxy that faces
a void, the galaxy encounters the highly recharged, partially isotropic
flux coming from the empty region. This reduces the expected drop-off in
gravitational push at large distances, flattening the rotation curve. No
change to the laws of gravity is needed; the environment naturally
reshapes the flux landscape.

Observed galaxy rotation curves, which remain high far from galactic
centers, are usually explained by assuming large halos of invisible dark
matter or by proposing that gravity itself changes at low accelerations,
as in MOND. Both approaches fit the data, but neither is derived from
basic physical processes. Dark matter is added as an unseen mass
component, and MOND is introduced by modifying the force law. Neither
provides a microscopic explanation for why galaxies should behave this
way.

In summary, voids become repulsive "high points" in the GCM flux because
empty regions recharge the flux while dense regions drain it. Matter
moves downhill in this landscape, explaining why voids stay empty, why
matter gathers at their walls, and why galaxies near voids exhibit
MOND-like rotation speeds. All of this follows directly from the
interaction rules of the two media, without introducing new fields or
modifying gravity itself.

## Maintaining Matter Balance in an Infinite Universe

In the Two-Medium Model, the universe is taken to be infinite and in
long-term equilibrium. For such a universe to remain stable, the two
media must not only exchange energy smoothly but must also maintain a
balance in the amount of matter present. The model provides a clear
pathway for matter creation. A traveling LCM transverse wave can
gradually gain energy through blueshifting as it enters increasingly
dense LCM regions. As its frequency rises, its cross-sectional exposure
to the GCM flux increases, allowing it to cast a growing shadow. This
initiates a feedback loop in which the wave becomes increasingly
confined. Once the confinement becomes strong enough, the wave collapses
into a localized standing-wave pair, interpreted as an
electron–positron creation event. In regions of very dense LCM—such
as planetary or stellar interiors—the positron can undergo further
confinement, eventually forming a proton.

This mechanism ensures a steady trickle of new matter throughout the
universe. But in an infinite, statistically steady cosmos, continuous
matter creation requires an accompanying process of matter destruction.
Without such a process, matter would accumulate indefinitely,
contradicting the assumption of long-term equilibrium. Identifying where
and how matter is ultimately broken down is therefore essential to
completing the model.

## Matter Destruction in Ultra-Dense Environments

If the universe continually creates matter, a full equilibrium also
requires a mechanism for matter destruction. In the Two-Medium Model,
the most natural environments for this are the extreme-density regions
associated with active galactic nuclei (AGN). In known astrophysics,
neutron stars already demonstrate that protons and electrons can be
forced into more compact states, forming neutrons to achieve tighter
nuclear packing. If matter were to be broken down entirely, beginning
with neutrons is the most plausible path, since their internal structure
allows charge to be conserved when they are dismantled. This suggests
that matter destruction would occur only in environments even denser
than neutron stars—regions where all incoming matter is first
compressed into neutron-rich form before any more fundamental breakdown
can occur. For this reason, 2MM proposes AGN cores as the primary sites
of matter destruction. While the process has not yet been modeled at the
scale of the neutron, the working hypothesis is that neutrons entering
these extreme environments are ultimately converted back into traveling
LCM wave energy, completing the matter cycle required for equilibrium in
an infinite universe.

## High-Energy Outflows and the Origin of AGN Jets

If AGN cores act as matter-destruction engines, then the energy released
from dismantling neutrons must reappear somewhere in the surrounding
LCM. In 2MM, this energy re-emerges not as random radiation, but as
highly organized, high-frequency LCM traveling waves. These waves carry
away the liberated energy and momentum, and because the central region
is extremely compact, the LCM flow naturally channels into narrow escape
paths where the GCM–LCM environment offers the least resistance. This
produces the familiar bipolar outflows known as AGN jets.

The collimation of these jets does not require magnetic fields or
mechanical nozzles—though such effects may contribute in real
astrophysical systems. In 2MM the jets arise simply because the LCM in
the immediate polar directions is less dense and less turbulent than in
the surrounding accretion structure. Once high-frequency LCM waves begin
escaping along these paths, the geometry reinforces itself: outflow
clears the channel further, allowing additional energy to escape the
same way. The jets therefore form naturally as self-sustaining conduits
for the release of matter-destruction energy.

From this perspective, AGN jets are the visible signature of the matter
cycle closing: matter falls inward, is compressed to neutron form, is
ultimately broken down into LCM traveling waves, and the released energy
exits the system through highly collimated, relativistic outflows. This
completes the balance required for a steady-state universe in 2MM.

## Jet Pinching and the Possibility of New Matter Formation

Close to the AGN, the emerging jets must pass through regions of high
LCM density and strong GCM depletion, producing natural bottlenecks
where the outflow can temporarily narrow or "pinch." In 2MM, this
behavior follows from the interaction of the two media: the liberated
LCM wave energy seeks the lowest-resistance channels, but the
surrounding environment near the AGN is crowded with dense material and
steep gradients in flux strength. The result is a constrained region
where the jet briefly tightens before breaking through into
lower-density surroundings. This is broadly consistent with observations
of jet collimation zones in astrophysics, though the underlying
mechanism differs.

These pinch regions may also represent zones where the conditions for
new matter formation could be met. In the 2MM picture, matter creation
occurs when high-frequency LCM waves become sufficiently confined to
cast a growing shadow in the GCM and collapse into standing-wave
structures. A jet pinch combines three relevant ingredients: unusually
intense LCM wave energy, temporary confinement by local pressure
gradients, and strong anisotropy in GCM exposure. Although highly
speculative, this raises the possibility that new matter might
occasionally form within or near these constricted regions. At present,
this remains only a suggestion; exploring whether jet dynamics can
trigger matter creation will require more detailed modeling and is left
as future work.

# Relativity

Relativity is often introduced through the language of *spacetime
curvature*—a mathematical surface that bends and twists in response to
mass and energy. For many people, this picture feels abstract and
untethered from anything physical. "Curved spacetime" is something you
can calculate, but not something you can visualize or touch.

## Space-Time is Real

In the 2MM framework a key insight is that everything normally
attributed to "spacetime" can be understood in much simpler, more
concrete terms if **the LCM itself *is* what we experience as space and
time.** Not metaphorically. Literally.

The LCM is a physical, elastic medium. It fills all of space. It can be
compressed, stretched, and shaped by energy and matter. And we — made
of standing waves in that medium — are part of it.

Under this interpretation, relativity becomes natural rather than
abstract:

- **Mass doesn't "curve spacetime."** Mass simply compresses the LCM.
  Those compression gradients *are* the curvature.

- **Gravity isn't a mysterious bending of geometry.** It is the result
  of the GCM flux pushing on regions where the LCM has been compressed
  by standing-wave particles. The momentum flow follows the gradient of
  LCM density — which is exactly what Einstein's field equations
  describe, just in a different language.

- **Time dilation isn't some strange slowing of clocks.** Time slows
  down because **light waves take longer to propagate through compressed
  LCM**, and every process in our bodies depends on those waves. If the
  medium compresses, the speed of light *in that medium* decreases —
  and because we are made of the medium's standing waves, *we slow down
  with it.* From the inside, everything still seems normal, because our
  measuring devices and biological processes slow in perfect sync with
  the light.

- **The speed of light appears constant because we can't step outside
  the medium to compare.** We only ever measure light using tools made
  of the same LCM. If the medium thickens or thins, our clocks thicken
  or thin with it. We never notice the change.

This resolves one of relativity's most confusing aspects: Why does the
speed of light seem constant from all perspectives, even when intuition
says it shouldn't be?

In 2MM, the answer is simple:

> **We are creatures of the LCM. Everything we can measure, know, or
> experience is bound to the properties of this medium. We cannot
> perceive the LCM directly, because doing so would be like trying to
> look at our own eyes without a mirror.**

From this viewpoint, relativity does not describe an abstract
four-dimensional manifold. It describes the behavior of a real physical
substrate under compression. Einstein's equations remain correct in
their predictions, but 2MM provides a different ontological picture:
instead of bending "spacetime," nature is reshaping the LCM, and we
move, age, and measure within that reshaped medium.

This makes relativity not an exotic distortion of geometry, but a simple
consequence of the physics of waves in a compressible medium — the
same medium that forms light, matter, and ourselves.

## Why Motion Through the LCM Causes Length Contraction

When relativity is taught using spacetime diagrams, length contraction
is often presented as a geometric effect: moving objects "shrink" along
their direction of travel because of how coordinates transform. While
mathematically precise, that explanation can feel abstract and
disconnected from physical intuition.

In the 2MM picture, length contraction emerges far more naturally. It is
simply what happens when an object moves rapidly through a **real,
compressible medium**: the LCM.

As an object accelerates, it must push its way through the LCM. At low
speeds this has almost no noticeable effect, but as the speed approaches
the propagation speed of transverse waves in the LCM (what we call the
speed of light), something important happens: the LCM begins to **pile
up** in front of the object.

This buildup creates a **directional compression gradient**:

- **Higher LCM density ahead of the object**

- **Normal LCM density behind it**

This gradient grows steeper the faster the object moves. And because all
matter in 2MM consists of standing waves stabilized by the surrounding
LCM, a denser medium in front exerts a real, physical inward pressure on
the wave structure.

Crucially, there is **no pulling from behind**. The LCM behind the
object is simply less compressed; it does not contribute actively to the
contraction. Instead, it fails to counterbalance the inward pressure
from the front. The net effect is a **one-sided squeezing force** along
the direction of motion.

From an outside observer's perspective, the object is genuinely
shortened — its entire structure is compressed along the direction of
travel by the piling up of LCM ahead of it.

But from the inside, nothing appears distorted.

All internal rulers, atoms, and even the biochemical processes that
constitute perception are made of the same standing waves immersed in
the same LCM. When the medium compresses in one direction, **every
component of the object compresses together**. No internal measurement
reveals the contraction because the measuring instruments themselves
contract by the same proportion.

This perspective makes length contraction feel intuitive:

> **Length contraction happens because fast motion through the LCM
> creates a directional compression gradient, and all matter — being
> made of LCM standing waves — must adapt to the compressed medium.**

There is no paradox, no mystical geometric effect, and no need to
imagine "shrinking" as an illusion. It is the straightforward mechanical
response of waves interacting with a real medium.

## Mutual Causation in the Two Media

Any elastic-aether model naturally interprets spacetime curvature as
variations in the density or tension of the medium itself. What 2MM adds
is a dynamic role for gravity in *maintaining* that curvature. In the
geometric view of relativity, the sequence seems straightforward: matter
and energy bend spacetime, and gravity is the motion of objects through
that curvature. In 2MM the picture becomes more intertwined. A standing
wave *is* a region of denser LCM, yet that denser region can only remain
stable because the GCM flux continually reinforces it through shadowing.
At the same time, the GCM would have nothing to shadow if not for the
density created by the standing wave. The result is a self-sustaining
feedback loop between the two media—neither the LCM nor GCM "comes
first," and no initial moment is required. The system simply persists,
with curvature, matter, and gravity all emerging from their mutual
interaction.

This interdependence between the two media leads to an intriguing
implication: for 2MM to function as described, the system cannot easily
accommodate a true "beginning." A beginning would require one medium to
exist and operate without the other, or for standing waves to form
before the shadowing effects that sustain them — both of which break
the causal loops that the model depends on. In fact, any notion of an
absolute beginning already strains causality in conventional physics as
well. In 2MM, this tension resolves naturally: the universe is not
something that starts and then evolves; it is something that
*self-maintains*, with structure emerging continually from the ongoing
reciprocity between the LCM and GCM.

# Absolute Time, the GCM, and Faster-Than-Light Transmission 

In 2MM, the presence of the GCM introduces a deeper notion of **absolute
time**—a timebase that exists independently of the LCM processes that
define our clocks and our experience. All measurement, sensation, and
physical activity in living systems occurs through LCM-standing-wave
structures, so we have access only to *LCM time*. But the GCM operates
on its own timescale. It is not constrained by the wave-propagation
speed of the LCM (the speed of light), nor by the relativistic limits
that emerge from LCM-based processes.

This idea aligns with Tom Van Flandern's careful analysis in **"[The
Speed of Gravity: What the Experiments
Say](https://www.metaresearch.org/cosmology/cosmology2/the-speed-of-gravity-what-the-experiments-say)"
(1998)**, where he reviewed timing delays, planetary motions, and signal
propagation. His conclusion was that gravity-like influences must
propagate extraordinarily fast:

> **Gravity must exceed 2 x 10$^10$ c**, at least twenty billion times
> the speed of light.

In the context of 2MM, this is exactly the behavior expected of the GCM
flux. It moves on an inaccessible absolute timebase and is free to
propagate vastly faster than light. This immediately suggests that
**faster-than-light transmission** is physically possible if a
civilization can learn to encode patterns into the GCM.

But this does **not** permit faster-than-light communication in the
usual sense. The distinction is fundamental:

- **Transmission** is the propagation of patterns through the GCM.

- **Communication** requires encoding and decoding, both of which happen
  in the LCM.

Encoding information into the GCM, and reading it out on the other end,
requires ordinary physical processes—electronics, detectors,
biological cognition—all of which are constrained by LCM time and the
speed of light. So even if a signal propagates nearly instantaneously
through the GCM, the total round-trip communication time cannot exceed
relativistic limits.

Thus:

> **FTL transmission is possible in theory. FTL round-trip communication
> is not.**

This preserves causality. No paradoxes arise because observers made of
LCM-standing-wave matter can never process a complete exchange faster
than light allows.

Yet the implications are profound. A civilization could, in principle,
carry on a **real-time conversation between Earth and Proxima
Centauri**, because the GCM would carry the signal almost instantly. The
subjective experience would feel simultaneous, even though the
underlying encoding and decoding steps remain light-speed bound.

#### Implication for SETI

This also leads to a natural expectation: if technological civilizations
develop a way to use the GCM for signaling, then **electromagnetic
communication becomes obsolete**. EM transmission is slow, lossy, and
limited by LCM constraints, whereas the GCM allows nearly instantaneous
signaling over interstellar distances.

Thus, 2MM implies that **SETI's strategy of searching the
electromagnetic spectrum may never detect advanced civilizations**, not
because they do not exist, but because their communication technology
would likely move beyond EM channels entirely. They would use the
GCM—an invisible, ultra-fast substrate that our current instruments
cannot yet manipulate or detect.

In this light, SETI's silence may be a clue rather than a contradiction:
advanced civilizations might be speaking in a medium we are not yet
listening to.

## Oumuamua as an Illustration of GCM Shielding (Speculative)

'Oumuamua's unusual properties—its extreme elongation, lack of
outgassing, and complex tumbling—have made it a persistent point of
interest in the literature. Natural origins remain entirely plausible.
However, within the 2MM framework, the object provides a useful example
for visualizing how **GCM shielding** behaves for elongated bodies.

In LeSage-style theories (and in 2MM's refinement of them), sufficiently
dense material can act as a **gravity shield**: its interior receives
slightly less GCM flux than its surface because a portion of the
incoming flux is absorbed or scattered. This shielding effect is tiny
for ordinary matter, but even tiny differences can accumulate or become
directionally structured if the object has an extreme geometry.

For an elongated body like 'Oumuamua, the degree of shielding is
**greater along its long axis** than along its short one. This means the
GCM flux deficit it produces—the *shadow* cast into downstream
space—depends on orientation. As the object rotates, the direction and
amplitude of the shadow vary in a periodic way.

This creates a simple conceptual possibility:

> A long, rotating object can act as a **passive gravitational beacon**,
> encoding a repeating pattern into the GCM flux purely by virtue of its
> geometry and rotation.

No technology is implied beyond the shape itself. No propulsion
mechanism is needed. No electromagnetic emission is required. The effect
arises naturally if an elongated mass rotates within a pervasive GCM
flux.

This does **not** suggest that 'Oumuamua *is* such a beacon. But its
geometry makes it a convenient illustration of how, in a dual-medium
ontology, even simple rotating shapes can produce **directionally
varying GCM signatures** — signatures that would be invisible
electromagnetically but potentially detectable in a theory where GCM
shielding plays a meaningful role.

# The Quantum Realm

Recall that 2MM starts with the assumption that the universe has at
least 2 distinct mediums.

- **LCM (Light Carrying Medium):** The substrate that houses all
  familiar matter. Particles are standing-wave structures in the LCM.
  Its density gradients shape forces, time dilation, pair production,
  etc.

- **GCM (Gravity Carrying Medium):** Ultra-small, ultra-fast, freely
  streaming corpuscles (LeSage-like). They set the baseline gravity
  field and provide the "shadowing" effect that matter manifests.

**Key philosophical pivot** Reality is not built out of one continuous
substrate but from **two coupled but scale-separated media**, each with
its own propagation speeds, pressure laws, and stability constraints.
The *interaction* between those two is what gives us mass, inertia,
charge asymmetry, nuclear structure, planetary growth, AGN destruction,
and so on.

## Why "quantum weirdness" shows up

In 2MM, every form of detectable matter—including the apparatus doing
the detecting—is a **composite standing-wave pattern** in the LCM.
When you push measurement down toward the characteristic wavelength of
that medium:

- The structure of the LCM becomes elastic, deformable, and dominated by
  interference.

- Measurement tools cannot anchor themselves to anything "rigid" because
  both the target and the probe are excitations of the same substrate.

- The stability conditions of LCM waves enforce intrinsic
  bandwidth/location tradeoffs—an analogue of uncertainty, not because
  of fundamental metaphysics, but because of **LCM-wave mechanics**.

Thus Heisenberg uncertainty emerges as a **structural property of our
medium**, not a universal principle of existence.

## Why this is not the whole story

2MM already assumes the LCM cannot be the entire universe. The
Copenhagen interpretation is not describing the deepest layer of
reality; it is describing the limits of observers confined to the LCM.
It leaves out:

- A deeper scale where **GCM corpuscles** move freely and do not behave
  as waves.

- A domain where trajectories are crisp and not subject to LCM-wave
  uncertainty.

- Energy budgets and mass formation pathways that lie outside the
  quantum regime.

Thus, the "quantum limit" is a **boundary of LCM-based observers**, not
of the universe as a whole.

# Methodology and Acknowledgements

The development of this model was highly iterative and heavily assisted
by modern AI tools. Without such tools, the model described here would
likely have taken months or years to assemble. As someone with a job, a
family, and limited hours to devote to speculative research, I would not
have been able to sustain the rapid cycle of hypothesis, critique, and
refinement that this project required. AI made that pace possible.

However, the role of AI requires careful qualification. These tools did
not "invent" the ideas presented here. Instead, they made the collective
knowledge of the scientific community navigable in a way that was never
previously accessible to individuals outside formal research settings.
During development, I would pose challenges and suggests constraints,
and the AI would respond with ideas, critiques, counterexamples, or
alternative possibilities drawn from patterns across the literature it
had been trained on. Most of these suggestions were rejected. Only a
small subset survived repeated rounds of filtering and conceptual
testing on my part.

A clear example of this collaborative dynamic is the dual-oscillation
model of the electron and positron. The idea of combining two
oscillatory modes with a phase offset was surfaced in dialogue with an
AI system. I would not have discovered that configuration unaided. But
the structural constraints that shaped it — the insistence on mirror
symmetry, three-dimensional non-flippability, pair-production balance,
and geometric stability — came from my own criteria. The AI generated
raw candidate ideas; I applied the conceptual standards that determined
whether they were tenable. The final standing-wave geometry emerged
through that interaction.

This dynamic applies throughout the project. The synthesis is my own.
But several individual components surfaced only because AI made it
possible to explore a wide conceptual space quickly. For that reason, I
want to acknowledge not only the role of AI but also the deeper lineage
behind it: the thousands of scientists, educators, writers, engineers,
and students whose work forms the substrate upon which such tools are
built. There is no practical way to identify every individual influence,
but their collective contribution underlies every AI-assisted iteration.

If you believe that any ideas in this document overlap with work you
have published, and you would like your contributions acknowledged or
referenced, please feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request.
I will review it and update the references accordingly.

Several strands of prior work influenced the direction of this model.
Halton Arp's empirical studies of redshift anomalies suggested that
large-scale cosmology might still contain unaddressed puzzles. Tom Van
Flandern's "Meta-Model" introduced the idea of multiple interacting
media, a conceptual seed that eventually grew into the Two-Medium
framework presented here. Dr. Chantal Roth's modeling of an elastic
aether encouraged me to consider that empty space could contain more
structure than I had previously assumed. The collection of papers in
Pushing Gravity: New Perspectives on Le Sage's Theory of Gravitation,
edited and contributed to by researcher Matthew R. Edwards, introduced
me to Le Sage-type gravity models and the challenges they
entail—particularly the overheating problem. Matthew himself first
introduced me to Expansion Tectonics decades ago, when I was completing
my computer science major at the University of Toronto.

While these works are not mainstream, they demonstrated that alternative
ontologies can still be logically organized and empirically motivated.

I present this work not as a finished theory, but as an invitation: to
reconsider whether some aspects of physical law might gain clarity from
a different underlying ontology, and to explore whether the ideas
outlined here might be refined, challenged, or developed further by
those with greater expertise and technical resources.
