# Two Medium Model (2MM)

The Two-Medium Model begins from the premise that there is only **one** fundamental force, **contact interactions**, and focuses on the portion of an assumed infinite universe that we can observe or meaningfully infer. It proposes that physical phenomena arise from the interaction of two media: the **Light-Carrying Medium** (LCM), a compressible continuum supporting transverse waves and standing-wave matter structures, and the **Gravity-Carrying Medium** (GCM), an ultra-fast, FTL particulate flux composed of components at far smaller scales. The GCM influences both quantum behavior and macroscopic gravity through shadowing and momentum-transfer effects. In this framework, all traditionally defined “fundamental forces” emerge as derived consequences of how these two media interact.

# Preface

This document is an attempt to answer a question that has interested me for many years: *Is it possible to build a coherent, medium-based picture of physics that connects phenomena across scales, from particles to cosmology, using simple and intuitive principles?*

I approached this project not as a professional physicist but as an amateur who has spent decades reading about science, puzzles, and anomalies that invite deeper questioning. My interest has always leaned toward the edges of what we understand: places where standard explanations work mathematically but remain conceptually opaque, or where observations fit uneasily into the prevailing frameworks.

The ideas presented here began with a few philosophical commitments: that interactions should be local, that waves require a medium, and that forces should have physical carriers rather than operating at a distance. These assumptions are not universally accepted, and they are not proposed as corrections to modern physics. They simply provided a different starting point, one that led me to explore whether a medium-based ontology might unify many disconnected pieces of physical behavior.

This is not a finished theory. It is a conceptual model: speculative, exploratory, and intentionally not defined mathematically. My hope is that general readers find it accessible, and that professionals find it interesting enough to question, critique, or even refine. Science progresses not only through detailed calculation, but also through new ways of seeing familiar things.

# Introduction

The Two-Medium Model (2MM) is a conceptual framework developed to explore whether many pieces of modern physics might be understood more intuitively if reinterpreted through two interacting physical media. This includes particle behavior, forces, gravity, cosmology, and certain geophysical observations. The goal of this work is not to dispute the empirical success of established theories such as quantum field theory or general relativity, but to examine whether a medium-based ontology can offer a unified geometric picture that connects phenomena across scales.

Modern physics is extraordinarily effective at describing what happens, yet often agnostic about *what things are*. Fields are treated as mathematical entities, forces arise from operators or curvature rather than physical mechanisms, and fundamental particles are defined by their properties rather than by internal structure. These approaches work, but they leave open the question of whether a more physically intuitive model might also exist. Even better, if such a model did exist that it might provide **new** insights.

The Two-Medium Model starts from a small set of philosophical assumptions: that interactions are local, that waves require a medium, and that gravity must be physically mediated. These assumptions are neither new nor universally accepted, but they open a path to constructing an alternative conceptual picture that remains grounded in observed phenomena. Beginning from these premises, the model introduces two distinct media: a compressible medium that supports transverse waves (LCM) and a high-speed particulate flux that produces gravitational shadowing (GCM). Matter, forces, and other phenomena are interpreted as emerging from the interaction between these two components.

This document summarizes the resulting framework. It is not a formal theory and does not attempt to replicate the mathematical precision of modern physics. Instead, it offers a structured conceptual model that appears internally coherent and that naturally produces explanations for a range of phenomena, from electric charge and magnetism to nuclear structure, planetary mass growth, redshift, and the function of active galactic nuclei. Some of these explanations parallel mainstream thinking; others are unconventional. All are presented with the intention of sparking curiosity and inviting further analysis.

Each section of this paper should be read in order, the model benefits from seeing how its pieces interlock: forces emerging from medium interactions, particles from wave breaking, cosmology from matter cycling, and planetary behavior from long-term LCM dynamics.

This work is offered as an exploration — an attempt to see what becomes possible when we start with different foundational assumptions and follow them consistently. If it prompts reflection, critique, or further development by readers more skilled or knowledgeable than myself, then it has achieved its purpose.

# Predictions

Although 2MM is not defined mathematically, it does make several qualitative predictions that differ from standard interpretations and could, in principle, be tested. These predictions arise directly from the model’s internal mechanisms: wave breaking, LCM/GCM interactions, particle structure, and the matter-creation/destruction cycle.

1. **A 12-hour diurnal variation in high-energy particle events** (a modern aether test based on LCM bow/wake asymmetry)
2. **[Hydrogen creation inside planets and moons](./earth-and-solar-system.md)** (and liquid water worlds should be abundant)
3. **Neutron destruction occurring inside active galactic nuclei** (as part of the matter-recycling cycle)
4. **Synthesis of heavier, high-compression variants of matter near the base of AGN jets**
5. **Singularities do not occur**
5. **Quantized intrinsic redshift in quasars**, and their **physical association with parent AGN**
6. **SETI is unlikely to succeed**, even if advanced civilizations exist

Each of these will be discussed in greater detail in relevant sections below.

# Methodology and Acknowledgements

The development of this model was highly iterative and heavily assisted by modern AI tools. Without such tools, the model described here would likely have taken months or years to assemble. As someone with a job, a family, and limited hours to devote to speculative research, I would not have been able to sustain the rapid cycle of hypothesis, critique, and refinement that this project required. AI made that pace possible.

However, the role of AI requires careful qualification. These tools did not “invent” the ideas presented here. Instead, they made the collective knowledge of the scientific community navigable in a way that was never previously accessible to individuals outside formal research settings. During development, I would pose challenges and suggests constraints, and the AI would respond with ideas, critiques, counterexamples, or alternative possibilities drawn from patterns across the literature it had been trained on. Most of these suggestions were rejected. Only a small subset survived repeated rounds of filtering and conceptual testing on my part.

A clear example of this collaborative dynamic is the dual-oscillation model of the electron and positron. The idea of combining two oscillatory modes with a phase offset was surfaced in dialogue with an AI system. I would not have discovered that configuration unaided. But the structural constraints that shaped it — the insistence on mirror symmetry, three-dimensional non-flippability, pair-production balance, and geometric stability — came from my own criteria. The AI generated raw candidate ideas; I applied the conceptual standards that determined whether they were tenable. The final standing-wave geometry emerged through that interaction.

This dynamic applies throughout the project. The synthesis is my own. But several individual components surfaced only because AI made it possible to explore a wide conceptual space quickly. For that reason, I want to acknowledge not only the role of AI but also the deeper lineage behind it: the thousands of scientists, educators, writers, engineers, and students whose work forms the substrate upon which such tools are built. There is no practical way to identify every individual influence, but their collective contribution underlies every AI-assisted iteration.

If you believe that any ideas in this document overlap with work you have published, and you would like your contributions acknowledged or referenced, please feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request. I will review it and update the references accordingly.

Several strands of prior work influenced the direction of this model. Halton Arp’s empirical studies of redshift anomalies suggested that large-scale cosmology might still contain unaddressed puzzles. Tom Van Flandern’s “Meta-Model” introduced the idea of multiple interacting media, a conceptual seed that eventually grew into the Two-Medium framework presented here. Dr. Chantal Roth’s modeling of an elastic aether encouraged me to consider that empty space could contain more structure than I had previously assumed. The collection of papers in Pushing Gravity: New Perspectives on Le Sage’s Theory of Gravitation, edited and contributed to by researcher Matthew R. Edwards, introduced me to Le Sage-type gravity models and the challenges they entail—particularly the overheating problem. Matthew himself first introduced me to Expansion Tectonics decades ago, when I was completing my computer science major at the University of Toronto.

While these works are not mainstream, they demonstrated that alternative ontologies can still be logically organized and empirically motivated.

I present this work not as a finished theory, but as an invitation: to reconsider whether some aspects of physical law might gain clarity from a different underlying ontology, and to explore whether the ideas outlined here might be refined, challenged, or developed further by those with greater expertise and technical resources.

## 1. Core Ontology: Two Interacting Media

### 1.1 LCM: The Wave-Supporting Medium

A compressible medium that supports both transverse and longitudinal disturbances.

* **Transverse waves** correspond to what we identify as light
* **Longitudinal compression waves** correspond to what modern physics interprets as gravitational waves, propagating at the same characteristic speed
* Stores energy as density gradients, torsion, and shear
* Breaks into localized standing waves under sufficiently high-frequency conditions
* Shapes how the GCM flux interacts with matter, influencing all forces

The LCM does not independently produce electric, magnetic, or nuclear effects; instead, its deformations provide one half of the mechanism behind all interactions.

### 1.2 GCM: The Gravity-Producing Medium

A pervasive, ultra-fast particulate flux—conceptually similar to a refined LeSage-type model.

* Slightly inelastic encounters generate shadowing effects experienced as gravity
* Shadow strength and momentum transfer depend critically on local LCM density and geometry
* Contributes to the short-range structure and cohesion of atomic nuclei
* Couples to LCM compression and shear, participating in both electrostatic and magnetic phenomena
* Contains mechanisms (discussed later) that resolve the classical LeSage overheating objection

The GCM is not solely a source of gravitational attraction; it provides the momentum-transfer component that, in combination with LCM structures, produces attractive and repulsive forces across all scales.

## 2. Matter as Standing Waves in the LCM

Many earlier physical models have attempted to describe matter as some form of localized wave. Classical ether theories imagined particles as knots or disturbances in a single universal medium. More recent “elastic aether” approaches propose that mass, charge, and quantum behavior arise from deformations or resonances in an elastic or fluid vacuum. Soliton-based models likewise treat matter as stable wave packets in nonlinear fields. These ideas share a common intuition: matter may be an organized pattern of motion rather than a separate substance.

What remains unresolved in all single-medium approaches, however, is the **problem of confinement**. In a uniform elastic medium, waves disperse; they do not naturally remain localized. A stable, particle-like standing wave requires some form of boundary condition or trapping mechanism, but a single-medium ether does not provide a clear physical origin for such boundaries. This limitation has historically constrained the explanatory reach of wave-as-matter theories.

### 2MM addresses the problem of standing-wave confinement by introducing a second substrate, the GCM, whose ultra-fast particulate flux interacts with the LCM. When transverse LCM waves concentrate into a small region, they locally reduce the incoming GCM flux, creating a gravitational shadow. This shadow increases the surrounding LCM compression, and the increased compression further confines the wave. The feedback continues until the system reaches a stable equilibrium. The wave becomes **trapped in a gravity-induced compression well of its own making**, forming a localized, self-sustaining standing wave. This cannot be overstated: **a separate substrate is required to stabilize standing waves in the LCM**.

This dual-medium interaction supplies a natural mechanism for the existence of stable matter waves—something difficult to obtain in any single-medium framework. To my knowledge, no prior model combines a compressible light-carrying medium with a separate gravitational flux in such a way that **confinement, particle structure, and gravitational response emerge from the same underlying dynamics**.

The ability of 2MM to explain how standing waves become self-confined is one of the model’s strongest conceptual features. It allows matter to arise not as an arbitrary postulate, but as a natural consequence of how two complementary media shape and reinforce one another.

> *A particularly influential example for this work is **Tom Van Flandern’s Meta Model**, which argued that the vacuum may consist of multiple interacting substrates and that gravity and light need not propagate through the same physical medium. While the Meta Model differs substantially from 2MM in mechanism and structure, its core idea, that distinct media may underlie different physical phenomena, provided the inspiration for 2MM.*

## 2.1 LCM Compression, Blueshift, and the Conditions for Wave Breaking

In 2MM, the behavior of light depends on the properties of the LCM it travels through. When the LCM is more compressed, it restores disturbances more slowly, and a traveling wave moves through the medium less freely. As a result, its crests crowd together, and the wave’s effective frequency increases. This offers a straightforward way to understand blueshift: when light enters a region of higher gravitational compression, the crests simply catch up to one another more quickly.

(How this picture relates to relativity is discussed later; here the focus is on the internal mechanics of the medium.)

This change in behavior becomes important when a wave moves into a region where the LCM is compressed enough that the medium can no longer support the oscillation. A wave that is perfectly stable at low compression can become unstable at higher compression. As the medium struggles to keep pace with the oscillation:

* the crests begin to pile up,
* energy concentrates into a shrinking region, and
* the traveling wave loses coherence.

At this threshold, **wave breaking** becomes possible. The breaking event does not destroy the energy; instead, it gathers into a compact region where new structures can form. Because the critical factor is the local LCM density and its spatial gradients, wave breaking—and therefore pair production—is most likely in environments with strong compression: near massive bodies, inside dense plasma, or in the deep interiors of planets.

This sets the stage for the next question: if a breaking wave condenses its energy into new structures, **what determines the nature of those structures?**

## 2.2 Why Wave Breaking Produces Two Chiral Standing Waves

Pair production always yields two particles—an electron and a positron—that have the same energy but opposite structure. For a wave-based model, this immediately suggests that matter must come in **two stable versions** that are related but not identical. The most natural relationship of this kind is **chirality**: two mirror-image patterns that cannot be rotated into one another.

This leads to a simple requirement: whatever standing-wave structure represents matter in the LCM must be able to appear in two phase-orderings—one corresponding to the electron and one to the positron.

Wave breaking provides a mechanism for producing such a pair. When a high-frequency or highly compressed wave collapses, it must conserve both energy and symmetry. A single standing wave cannot satisfy this symmetry alone. But two standing waves—formed together, equal in magnitude, opposite in internal phase alignment—can. The collapse therefore resolves naturally into **two chiral standing waves**, identical except for how their internal oscillatory modes line up in time.

This provides a clean explanation for why pair production produces matter–antimatter pairs, and why they are mirror opposites in their internal structure. It also prepares the ground for the next step: understanding the internal geometry of these standing waves and how their phase alignment encodes charge.

### 2.3 Dual-Mode Helical Standing Waves

To satisfy the symmetry and stability requirements of wave breaking, matter must consist of **two oscillations** in the LCM:

* A **radial compression/expansion mode**
* A **torsional shear mode**

When these two oscillations are offset by a small **phase lead or lag**, the result is a **helical standing wave**.

This configuration naturally produces:

* A **lead-mode helix** → electron
* A **lag-mode helix** → positron

identical in energy but opposite in **compression sign, torsional direction, and chirality**.

From this geometry arise:

* **Electric charge**, as the sign of the radial compression mode
* **Magnetic dipoles**, from the torsional component
* **Spin and helicity**, from the overall structure
* The correct symmetry for pair creation

### 2.4 The Origin of LCM Compression Fields

When a wave breaks into a standing-wave particle, its energy becomes highly concentrated.
This concentrated energy presents a larger effective opacity to the GCM flux, causing a **stronger local shadow**.

That shadowing has two effects:

1. It creates an inward push toward the standing wave (gravity-like effect)
2. It squeezes the surrounding LCM, producing the **LCM compression field** characteristic of charged particles

Thus, LCM compression fields do not arise spontaneously;
**they exist because GCM shadowing intensifies around concentrated energy.**

This provides the missing conceptual chain:

> **Standing-wave energy → stronger GCM shadow → inward momentum flux → LCM compression field.**

These compression fields then participate in electrostatic, magnetic, and nuclear phenomena.

### 2.5 The Proton: Why the Lag-Mode Collapses in Dense LCM

A proton forms when a **lag-mode standing wave** (the positron-type mode) enters a region of sufficiently compressed LCM.
The key point is that **lag-mode and lead-mode standing waves respond very differently to increasing LCM density**.

#### Why the lag-mode collapses

In the lag-mode:

* The **compression component lags behind the shear component**
* Which means each oscillation cycle briefly concentrates energy closer to the center of the standing wave
* This internal focusing becomes more pronounced as LCM density increases

In dense LCM environments:

1. The inward GCM push increases
2. The LCM returns to equilibrium more slowly
3. The lagging compression mode cannot “reinflate” fast enough
4. Energy accumulates at the center
5. The standing wave collapses into a **smaller, denser, more tightly wound state**

This collapse state is what we identify as the **proton**.

#### Why the lead-mode does *not* collapse

The electron (lead-mode):

* Has the compression component **ahead** of the torsional component
* Which distributes energy outward rather than inward during each oscillation cycle
* Producing a more stable “outer-skewed” structure

As LCM density rises:

* The inward GCM push still increases
* But the outward-biased dynamics of the lead-mode allow it to stabilize at a slightly larger radius instead of collapsing
* It becomes more confined but does **not** focus energy inward

Thus, **lead-mode remains stable**, while **lag-mode becomes unstable above a threshold**.

#### Result: Hydrogen Formation

In environments where the LCM is driven into unusually high compression—such as planetary interiors or other steep-gradient regions—the internal modes of matter respond in predictable ways. Under these conditions, the lag-mode naturally contracts into a proton-like state, while the lead-mode remains electron-like, creating a straightforward pathway for hydrogen to form as a stable product of extreme compression.

This mechanism preserves charge balance and operates independently of any primordial supply of material. A discussion of why this remains feasible even when naïve density estimates might suggest otherwise—and how it shapes the evolution of planets and moons—is presented in the companion page [Earth and the Solar System](./earth-and-solar-system.md).

#### Why the Proton Does Not Decompress in Low-Density LCM

Once the lag-mode collapses into a proton, its structure becomes **self-stabilizing**.
The collapsed configuration has:

* a deeper GCM shadow,
* higher internal energy density,
* and an LCM compression field tightly bound to it.

As long as the GCM flux remains present (which it always does):

* the inward momentum transfer maintains the proton’s compressed state,
* even in regions where the surrounding LCM density is much lower than where it originally formed.

In low-density LCM:

* the *external* compression weakens,
* but the proton’s **own energy concentration** and **GCM opacity** continue to generate a strong local inward push,
* keeping the structure tightly wound.

The proton remains in this state because its configuration corresponds to a **stable energy minimum under the combined influence of its own LCM/GCM fields**, not a temporary response to the external environment.

A useful analogy is:

> **Once a rubber ball is tightly compressed into a new shape and chemically cross-linked, it keeps that shape even when removed from the external force that formed it.**

The proton is effectively a **metastable collapsed standing wave** — once formed, it stays proton-like everywhere unless subjected to extreme environments (e.g., inside AGN cores) that can destabilize even this compact mode.

### 2.6 The Neutron: Paired Standing Waves in a Combined Mode

A **neutron** forms when a proton-like lag-mode structure and an electron-like lead-mode structure combine into a single, phase-locked standing wave.
This combined mode:

* Has **balanced chirality**
* Produces a **less sharply peaked LCM compression gradient** than a proton
* Is **neutral** with respect to electric effects (compression fields partially cancel)
* Is stable **only inside nuclei**, where LCM and GCM conditions support the paired structure

Outside a nucleus, the neutron’s combined mode is unstable and decays into a proton, electron, and a release into the LCM (a neutrino-like disturbance).

## 3. Forces as Medium Interactions

### 3.1 Electrostatic Forces (Compression + Shadowing)

Electrostatic behavior emerges from the interaction of:

* **LCM compression fields** around charges, and
* **GCM shadowing patterns** shaped by those fields.
* **Like charges repel** because their compressed LCM fields resist overlap.
* **Opposite charges attract** because their opposite-mode compression fields fit together more easily and enhance mutual GCM shadowing.

Electrostatic forces are therefore not “produced” by either medium alone.
They arise from the **balance** between GCM pressure and LCM deformation.

### 3.2 Magnetic Forces: Motion-Induced and Intrinsic

#### Intrinsic Magnetic Dipoles (from Standing-Wave Structure)

Every electron has a built-in **helical torsional pattern** in the surrounding LCM due to its dual-mode standing-wave structure.
This helical deformation forms a **tiny magnetic dipole** even when the electron is stationary.

Because the electron’s helix has a direction (left-handed or right-handed depending on phase mode), it has a **preferred orientation** relative to how the LCM flows past it.

When an electron **moves through the LCM**, the flow around it becomes asymmetric:

* the helical torsion experiences **greater resistance on one side**,
* the GCM flux also interacts asymmetrically with the deformed LCM,
* and the combined effect produces a **torque** that tends to align the electron’s dipole with its direction of motion.

This makes the electron behave a bit like a spinning object aligning in a fluid stream — but governed by LCM/GCM interactions rather than hydrodynamic drag.

#### Current-Induced Magnetism (Collective Alignment of Microscopic Helices)

When many electrons move together in a shared direction (as in an electric current):

1. Their individual helical dipoles are **biased toward alignment** by motion through the LCM.
2. The skewing of their torsional fields produces **coherent LCM shear patterns**.
3. These shear patterns interact with the GCM flux to create a **macroscopic circular field** around the current.

Thus, the familiar magnetic field around a wire is the **summed effect** of many electrons’ aligned helical dipoles and their motion-induced asymmetries.

#### Ferromagnetism (Alignment Without Large Currents)

Ferromagnetism arises from a different but related mechanism:

* In certain lattice structures, electron standing waves prefer specific orientations due to geometric and energetic constraints.
* These orientations can become **locked** through the interplay of LCM torsion, GCM shadowing, and lattice symmetry.
* When many electrons in nearby atoms hold aligned helical dipoles, the material acquires a **persistent macroscopic magnetic field** even without current.

Ferromagnetism is therefore the **static alignment** of intrinsic dipoles, whereas current magnetism is the **dynamic alignment** produced by motion through the LCM.

Both arise from the **same underlying helical geometry** of the electron, but they differ in mechanism and scale.

### 3.3 Nuclear Structure: Why Only Proton–Neutron Pairs Bind

#### Proton–Proton Interaction: Repulsion Dominates

At long and moderate distances, two protons **repel strongly** because their LCM compression fields overlap.
The proton’s compression field is:

* steep,
* dense,
* sharply peaked near the core,
* and highly resistant to deformation.

This makes proton–proton repulsion extremely strong at short separations.

Even though protons attract each other through **GCM shadowing** (gravity-like inward push), the repulsive pressure from overlapping LCM compression fields grows far faster than the inward GCM pull.

**Result:**
Even if forced close together, **protons cannot be made to stick**.
Repulsion always wins before gravity has a chance to dominate.

#### Neutron–Neutron Interaction: Insufficient Attraction

A neutron’s LCM compression field is **much softer** because its internal standing-wave structure is larger and less tightly wound than a proton’s.

* The neutron core radius is larger.
* Its compression gradient is shallower.
* Its GCM opacity is lower than a proton’s.

Because of this:

1. **Gravity** between two neutrons is weaker than between two protons (larger radius → lower shadowing opacity).
2. **LCM repulsion** is also weaker, but not weak enough to be overcome.
3. Neutrons cannot be brought close enough for GCM attraction to dominate.

**Result:**
Neutron–neutron pairs are **not stable**.
Gravity never becomes strong enough to overcome even their softer repulsion.

#### Why Proton–Neutron Pairs *Are* Stable

The proton–neutron interaction is special because their complementary structures fit together more effectively than like–like pairs.

##### A. Smaller combined separation → stronger GCM attraction

A proton’s collapsed core is **smaller** than a neutron’s.
When a proton and neutron are pushed together:

* their centers can approach **closer** than two protons or two neutrons can,
* because the neutron’s softer LCM cloud allows deeper overlap,
* enabling **stronger GCM shadowing** (i.e., stronger gravitational-like inward push).

Closer centers = much stronger short-range attraction.

##### B. Reduced LCM repulsion

Because the neutron’s LCM compression field is gentle:

- A proton can approach a neutron to a separation that would already generate overwhelming repulsion between two protons
- At those separations, the repulsive pressure from the neutron’s softer profile remains manageable.

This allows gravity (via GCM shadowing) to rise faster than repulsion, creating the possibility of a bound state.

##### C. Energetically favorable packing

The proton’s steep compression gradient combined with the neutron’s softer compression gradient yields a geometry where:

* the proton can “nestle” closer to the neutron’s center,
* the neutron absorbs and buffers the steepest LCM gradients,
* the composite structure has **lower total energy**.

**Result:**

A proton–neutron pair forms a **stable nuclear bond** through the same LCM/GCM interplay that governs all other forces — no special “strong force” is required. Proton–neutron pairing is the only combination that yields a stable nuclear bond.

## 3.5 Gravity: Long-Range GCM Shadowing and the Resolution of the Heat Crisis

### Gravity as GCM Shadowing

In 2MM, long-range gravity is the simplest part of the entire force framework.
Every standing wave (electron, proton, neutron) creates a **region of reduced transparency** to the GCM flux because its concentrated energy interacts inelastically with passing GCM particles.

This produces:

* a **lower GCM flux** on the side facing another mass,
* a **higher flux** on the opposite side,
* and therefore a **net inward momentum push**.

At large separations, LCM compression fields fall off rapidly, so only the GCM shadowing remains.
Thus gravity becomes the **long-range limit** of the same interaction that produces:

* nuclear cohesion,
* electric attraction,
* magnetic forces.

### Resolving the LeSage Heat Crisis

A classical LeSage flux produces far too much heating unless two problems are solved:

1. **How particles avoid overheating at quantum scales**
2. **How planets avoid overheating at macroscopic scales**

2MM resolves *both*, but through different mechanisms.

#### Quantum-Scale Resolution: The Standing Wave as an Energy Absorber

A proton or electron is not a solid billiard ball absorbing GCM impacts.
It is a **standing wave in the LCM**, sustained by:

* inward GCM momentum transfer,
* outward LCM compression pressure,
* and the internal oscillation pattern of the wave itself.

This creates a **continuous dynamic balance**, not a “heating” process.

Energy from GCM interactions is not simply dumped into the particle:

* It is absorbed by maintaining the particle’s LCM compression field,
* which constantly tries to decompress,
* and therefore requires a constant inward GCM push.

Thus the GCM does not “heat” the proton;
it simply provides the energy needed to **hold the standing-wave shape in a compressed state**.

Any excess energy above this maintenance level is naturally shed as:

* tiny adjustments in LCM compression,
* minute outward LCM fluctuations,
* and (rarely) neutrino-like releases during particle transitions.

The proton’s “collapsed” state is stable precisely because **it can absorb GCM energy without runaway heating**.

#### Planetary-Scale Resolution: Matter Creation as a Heat Sink

At macroscopic scales, GCM shadowing would produce enormous thermal input *if* the energy accumulated in matter.
But in 2MM, dense regions of LCM (e.g., planetary interiors) provide an additional mechanism:

#### Wave Breaking → Proton Creation → Energy Extraction

Inside massive bodies:

* LCM density rises,
* wave breaking becomes common,
* lag-mode collapses form new protons,
* and energy is consumed to create additional standing waves.

Matter creation is an **energy sink**:

* It pulls energy out of the LCM,
* which ultimately originates from the GCM momentum flux.

This stabilizes planetary temperatures over geological time.
Matter production increases until energy inflow and outflow reach equilibrium.

Thus the classical overheating crisis is resolved by **energy conversion into rest-mass**.

### Summary of Gravity

Gravity is simply:
* GCM shadowing at long range
* LCM-shaped force gradients at short range

The heat crisis is avoided because:

* **Particles** absorb GCM energy by maintaining their standing-wave compression fields.
* **Planets** absorb GCM energy through continuous matter creation via wave breaking.

This makes the entire two-medium framework self-consistent across all scales.

> **Earth Expansion as a Research Context**
> 
> The idea that Earth’s radius may have changed over geological time has appeared in many forms throughout the history of geophysics. Although it sits outside the modern mainstream, it has been examined seriously by researchers such as Samuel Warren Carey, who viewed expansion as a possible unifying framework for continental drift, and Dr. James Maxlow, who produced detailed reconstructions suggesting smaller ancient Earth radii. A full discussion of the evidence and counter-arguments is beyond the scope of this paper; readers interested in the broader debate are encouraged to consult those primary works.

Rather than beginning with geological interpretation, 2MM arrives at the idea through the internal physics of the LCM.

> 
> One of the long-standing obstacles for expansion hypotheses has been the absence of a physically grounded mechanism capable of driving sustained planetary growth. 2MM does not claim to resolve the entire geological debate, but it does offer a plausible mechanism where none previously existed—providing a fresh context in which expansion models can be reconsidered.

## 4. Cosmology in an Infinite Medium

### 4.1 Foundational Assumption: An Infinite, Timeless Universe

Up to this point, the Two-Medium Model has focused on waves, particles, and forces.
But these ideas rest on a deeper cosmological premise that must now be stated explicitly:

**2MM assumes a universe that is infinite in all three spatial dimensions, infinite in scale, and infinite in time.**

This means:

* there is **no beginning** and **no end**,
* there is **no smallest scale** and **no largest scale**,
* structure can exist at every level, from far below the Planck scale to far beyond the observable cosmos,
* and the universe is never globally created or destroyed — only locally transformed.

This assumption is not philosophical.
It is required because many of the mechanisms in 2MM — continuous wave breaking, matter recycling, stable media, and long-term energetic balance — only make sense in a universe that is not temporally or spatially bounded.

### 4.2 Clarifying the Model’s Assumptions: LCM and GCM

Although much of the model is deductive, 2MM does rest on two physical assumptions about the nature of space:

1. **The LCM (Light-Carrying Medium)**

   * This medium is *induced* from observation:
     the finite speed of light, interference, coherence, redshift, wavelength stretching, and gravitational frequency shifts all point toward a wave-supporting medium with elasticity and inertia.
   * In this sense, the LCM is not a speculative addition but a **generalization of an observed pattern**: waves in nature always travel in something.

2. **The GCM (Gravity-Carrying Medium)**

   * Unlike the LCM, the GCM has no direct observational signature; it is introduced to supply a **local, contact-interaction mechanism for gravity**, consistent with momentum transfer and the avoidance of action at a distance.
   * Its existence is the model’s one genuinely new assumption.

A third assumption underlies both media:

3. **An infinite, steady-state universe**

   * Necessary to provide the stable environment in which both LCM and GCM operate, recycle energy, and support wave-breaking and matter creation without global beginning or end.

With these assumptions defined, the rest of the Two-Medium Model — particle structure, forces, nuclear behavior, planetary evolution, and cosmology — follows as a logical chain of consequences.

### 4.3 A Note to the Reader: Suspending Two Major Objections

Before going further, it is worth acknowledging that two observations are commonly viewed as decisive evidence for a Big Bang cosmology: **cosmological redshift** and the **cosmic microwave background (CMB).**
Readers familiar with modern cosmology may understandably see these as immediate contradictions to the idea of an infinite, steady-state universe.

At this stage, I would simply ask the reader to **withhold that objection temporarily**.
Both of these observations are discussed in detail later in the document, and the Two-Medium Model provides its own explanations for them based on the behavior of the LCM and GCM.

The intention here is not to dismiss established interpretations, but to present an alternative viewpoint and allow the internal logic of the model to unfold before revisiting those key observations.

### 4.4 Matter Creation and the Necessity of Matter Destruction

Earlier in this document, we described how **wave breaking in regions of high LCM compression** can create new matter.
In particular:

* high-frequency LCM waves become unstable,
* lag-mode standing waves collapse into protons,
* lead-mode waves become electrons,
* and additional particle combinations occasionally form neutrons.

These processes were explored in detail in Sections 2 and 3.
Here, we revisit them briefly only to highlight their cosmological significance.

If the universe is **infinite in time**, and if wave breaking naturally creates matter in the dense LCM environments surrounding stars, planets, and other structures, then a simple consequence follows:

> **Matter creation must be balanced by matter destruction.**
> Otherwise, an infinite universe would accumulate matter without limit.

This requirement applies across all scales, from electrons to the most stable known particle: the **proton**.
In modern physics the proton is treated as effectively indestructible outside extreme environments.
But in an infinite, steady-state cosmos, **some process must eventually unmake even the proton**, returning its standing-wave energy back into the underlying media.

### 4.5 Neutron Stars: Extreme Compression Without Matter Destruction

Before talking about true matter destruction, it helps to look at a case that is already part of mainstream physics: the **neutron star**.

In standard astrophysics, when a massive star collapses, its core can reach densities so high that:

* electrons are forced into protons,
* protons and electrons combine to form neutrons (plus a neutrino),
* and the result is an object made predominantly of **neutron matter**.

In Two-Medium terms, this can be reinterpreted as:

* extreme LCM compression and GCM shadowing push proton and electron standing waves so close that their helical patterns can no longer remain distinct;
* the lead-mode (electron-like) and lag-mode (proton-like) structures **lock together** into a combined standing wave — the **neutron mode**;
* this combined mode has a **larger core radius** but a **softer LCM compression profile**, allowing tighter packing of matter than a pure proton–electron mixture.

Crucially:

* **no charge is destroyed** in this process;
* the proton’s positive and electron’s negative contributions are now encoded in a **single neutral standing-wave configuration**;
* the overall charge balance of the star is preserved.

Neutron stars are therefore an example of **matter rearrangement under extreme compression**, not matter destruction.
They show that protons and electrons can be reorganized into a different, denser configuration without violating charge conservation.

This sets the stage for the next step:
what happens when the environment is even more extreme than a neutron star.

### 4.6 AGN Cores: Neutron Destruction and Charge-Conserving Recycling

In an infinite, steady-state universe, rearrangement is not enough.
At some point, **standing waves must be fully dismantled**, returning their energy to the LCM and GCM to complete the cycle of matter creation and destruction.

Two-Medium Model assigns this role to the **deepest regions of active galactic nuclei (AGN)** — environments where LCM density and GCM flux are pushed beyond even neutron-star conditions.

AGN are layered:

* **Outer regions / disks:** high-energy radiation, strong LCM gradients, frequent wave breaking → pair production and some matter creation.
* **Intermediate regions:** neutron-star-like conditions, where protons and electrons can be driven into neutron configurations.
* **Innermost core:** LCM density so extreme that even the neutron standing wave becomes unstable.

In the **innermost AGN core**, 2MM proposes:

* the combined neutron standing wave can no longer maintain its locked structure;
* the lead and lag components lose their phase-locked relationship;
* the neutron mode **unravels** back into high-frequency LCM disturbances (very energetic transverse and possibly longitudinal waves).

Because the neutron is **neutral overall**, its destruction can proceed without violating charge conservation:

* the positive and negative components that were geometrically encoded in the neutron’s internal structure are annihilated in a **balanced way**;
* any residual charge asymmetries must be carried away by equal and opposite charged particles (e.g., electron–positron pairs) or by further rearrangements in the surrounding plasma;
* globally, **net charge remains zero**.

So when we speak of “matter destruction” in AGN, we are not saying:

> *“A lone proton magically vanishes and charge disappears.”*

Rather, the sequence is:

1. **Protons + electrons → neutrons** (extreme compression, neutron-star-like conditions; charge conserved).
2. **Neutrons → high-frequency LCM waves** in cores where LCM density exceeds neutron stability (matter destroyed, but *neutral* structures dissolving).
3. Any remaining charged particles are balanced in pairs or redistributed so that **overall charge conservation holds**.

The net effect:

* AGN outer regions can still **create matter** via wave breaking and pair production;
* AGN inner cores **destroy matter** by dismantling neutron standing waves into pure LCM disturbances;
* the resulting high-energy waves propagate outward, seeding new cycles of wave breaking and matter creation elsewhere.

In this way, **AGN act as charge-conserving matter recyclers** in an infinite universe —
not by arbitrarily erasing particles, but by **first neutralizing them (into neutrons) and then dismantling those neutral structures** under extreme LCM compression.

### 4.7 Quasars as Newborn Matter in the Two-Medium Model

In the previous sections we described how active galactic nuclei (AGN) contain regions where matter can both **form** and **dissolve**, depending on the local LCM density.
If neutron destruction in AGN cores releases enormous amounts of high-frequency LCM waves, and if wave breaking naturally creates new standing waves in dense environments, then a natural question arises:

**Where in the universe do we see objects that might represent newly created matter?**

Within the logic of 2MM, the primary observational counterpart is the **quasar**.

#### 4.7.1 Observational Clues Linking Quasars to AGN Activity

Astronomer **Halton Arp** and others documented numerous cases where quasars appear:

* in close angular alignment with active galaxies,
* lying precisely along the axes of radio or plasma jets,
* often in **symmetrically placed pairs** on opposite sides of an AGN,
* sometimes connected to the parent galaxy by luminous or radio structures,
* and frequently showing a gradual **decrease in redshift with increasing distance** from the parent object.

These associations themselves are observational; interpretations differ.
But within 2MM, the correlations make conceptual sense.

#### 4.7.2 Where Quasars Come From: The Jet-Base Compression Bottleneck

In the Two-Medium Model, wave breaking requires **blueshift**, which occurs only when a wave enters a region of *higher* LCM density.
Because the outer regions of an AGN have lower LCM density, radiation moving outward cannot break there — it redshifts instead.

Thus, newly created matter must form in regions where the LCM becomes **temporarily more compressed**, not less.

The correct location is the **base of the jets**, where collimation, magnetic pinching, and gravitational focusing create a natural **compression bottleneck**.
As the high-frequency waves released from the AGN core pass through this bottleneck, they encounter **locally increased LCM density**.
This causes further **blueshift**, which can push the highest frequency waves above the threshold for **wave breaking**.

Wave breaking at the jet base produces bursts of new matter — electrons, protons, and sometimes neutrons.
These compact, energetic clouds of freshly created matter appear observationally as **quasars**.

#### 4.7.3 Why Quasars Often Occur in Symmetrical Pairs

Because AGN jets are typically bipolar:

* both jet bases create similar compression bottlenecks,
* both eject newly formed matter along opposite axes,
* and both produce compact, high-redshift objects under nearly symmetric conditions.

This naturally explains:

* quasar pairs flanking active galaxies,
* nearly equal brightness and redshift in some pairs,
* and alignment along the AGN’s jet direction.

This symmetry is a natural prediction of 2MM.

#### 4.7.4 Why Quasars Have Higher Redshift Than Their Parent AGN

If quasars originate from AGN, a natural question arises:

**Why do quasars almost always exhibit *higher* redshift than the galaxies that appear to eject them?**

In the Two-Medium Model, the answer follows directly from how **wave breaking**, **standing-wave formation**, and **LCM compression** operate.

##### 1. Quasars are born in regions of *extreme* LCM compression

At the jet-base compression bottleneck:

* LCM density is at its steepest gradient outside the AGN core,
* high-frequency LCM waves blueshift as they enter this region,
* and the resulting wave breaking produces **new standing waves in an unusually compressed environment**.

This means that the *initial* standing-wave structures (electrons, protons, neutrons) within the newly formed quasar:

* are created at **higher internal energy**,
* have **tighter compression-bound modes**,
* and sit inside **steeper LCM density gradients** than the same particles inside the parent galaxy.

Because emitted light must climb out of this steeper compression well:

* it experiences a **larger gravitational redshift–like effect**,
* compounded by the intrinsic energy-state of newly created matter.

Thus, newborn quasars naturally emit **more redshifted light** than the parent AGN.

##### 2. Newly formed matter starts in a higher internal energy state

A core principle of 2MM is that the **rest structure** of a standing-wave particle can vary slightly depending on the LCM environment in which it forms.

In regions of strong compression:

* standing waves are created in a **more compact, higher-energy configuration**,
* transitions between internal modes emit photons with **shorter intrinsic wavelengths**,
* but as those photons leave the compressed region, they **redshift more** than photons emitted from less compressed environments.

This combination produces a net **higher observed redshift**.

The AGN’s matter, by contrast:

* is older,
* less compressed,
* and closer to its long-term equilibrium standing-wave structure.

Therefore, AGN light shows lower intrinsic redshift.

##### 3. As quasars move outward, their redshift decreases

Once ejected along the jet:

* the newly formed quasar begins traveling into regions of progressively lower LCM density,
* its internal standing waves relax toward lower-energy geometric configurations,
* and its emitted light redshifts *less* compared to its initial value.

This matches Arp’s long-standing observation:

* **quasars farther from the parent AGN often show *lower* redshift**,
* suggesting evolution rather than large cosmological distance.

#### 4.7.5 Controversy and Caution

The idea that quasars originate from AGN and carry intrinsic redshift is **not** part of mainstream cosmology.
Most astronomers interpret quasar redshift as purely cosmological.
The quasar–galaxy associations noted by Arp are generally attributed to chance line-of-sight alignments.

The purpose here is not to adjudicate that debate, but to show that within the internal logic of the Two-Medium Model:

* AGN cores **destroy** neutron matter,
* jet-base bottlenecks **create** new matter,
* and the resulting compact objects **match observed quasar behavior**.

This sets the stage for the next section:
**4.8 Quantized Intrinsic Redshift**, which follows naturally from the standing-wave structure of matter in 2MM.
