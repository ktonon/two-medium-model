\section{Relativity}

Relativity is often introduced through the language of \emph{spacetime curvature}---a mathematical surface that bends and twists in response to
mass and energy. For many people, this picture feels abstract and
untethered from anything physical. ``Curved spacetime'' is something you
can calculate, but not something you can visualize or touch.
