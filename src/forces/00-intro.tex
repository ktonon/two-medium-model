With the structure of matter established, the next step is to understand
how matter \textbf{interacts}. In 2MM, there are no separate
``fundamental forces'' in the conventional sense. All
interactions---electrostatic, magnetic, nuclear, and
gravitational---arise from the same underlying mechanism: the way
\textbf{LCM compression fields} and \textbf{GCM momentum flux} respond
to the presence, motion, and geometry of standing-wave particles.

Every particle creates a characteristic distortion in the LCM, shaped by
its internal oscillation pattern and maintained by its GCM shadow. When
particles approach one another, these distortions overlap, reinforce, or
interfere in predictable ways. The GCM flux responds to these
distortions as well, altering the inward or outward momentum transfer
between the two media. What we interpret as ``forces'' are simply
\textbf{the adjustments required for the two media to maintain equilibrium while accommodating multiple standing waves in close proximity}.

This framework removes the need to postulate separate fundamental
interactions. Instead:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  \textbf{Electrostatic forces} arise from how LCM compression fields
  overlap or oppose each other.
\item
  \textbf{Magnetic forces} arise from interactions between torsional
  components of standing waves and the relative motion of their
  compression fields.
\item
  \textbf{Nuclear forces} emerge from extreme GCM shadowing and the
  resulting high-pressure compression wells at very short range.
\item
  \textbf{Gravity} is the macroscopic result of accumulated GCM
  shadowing from many particles acting in concert.
\end{itemize}

By tracing all interactions back to a single mechanism---the dynamic
cooperation between LCM elasticity and GCM flux---2MM provides a unified
physical origin for force behavior across all scales. In this sense, the
model does not contain multiple independent forces at all. \textbf{Every interaction reduces to a single kind of physical event: an inelastic momentum exchange between the two media.} What appear to us as distinct
forces are simply different geometric outcomes of how particles and
their compression fields shape, redirect, or obstruct the continual
movement of the GCM through the LCM.
