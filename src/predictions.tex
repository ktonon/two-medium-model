\section{Predictions}

Although 2MM is not defined mathematically, it does make several
qualitative predictions that differ from standard interpretations and
could, in principle, be tested. These predictions arise directly from
the model's internal mechanisms: wave collapse, LCM/GCM interactions,
particle structure, and the matter-creation/destruction cycle.

  modern aether test based on LCM bow/wake asymmetry)
\item
  \textbf{\hyperref[solar-system]{Hydrogen creation inside planets and moons}} (and liquid water worlds should be abundant)
\item
  \textbf{\hyperref[agn]{Neutron destruction occurring inside active galactic nuclei}} (as part of the
  matter-recycling cycle)
\item
  \textbf{\hyperref[quasars]{Quantized intrinsic redshift in quasars}}, and their \textbf{physical association with parent AGN}
\item
  \textbf{\hyperref[absolute-time]{SETI is unlikely to succeed}}, even if advanced civilizations exist
\item
  \textbf{\hyperref[momentum-flow]{Matter cannot hold its shape in the intergalactic voids}}
\end{enumerate}

Each of these will be discussed in greater detail in relevant sections
below.
