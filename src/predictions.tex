\section{Predictions}

Although 2MM is not defined mathematically, it does make several
qualitative predictions that differ from standard interpretations and
could, in principle, be tested. These predictions arise directly from
the model's internal mechanisms: wave collapse, LCM/GCM interactions,
particle structure, and the matter-creation/destruction cycle.

\begin{enumerate}

\item
  \textbf{\hyperref[earth-and-the-solar-system]{Hydrogen creation inside planets and moons}} (and liquid water worlds should be abundant)
\item
  \textbf{\hyperref[voids-as-repulsive-regions]{Cosmic voids as repulsive regions}}
\item
  \textbf{\hyperref[neutron-formation-and-release-in-agn-cores]{Neutron destruction occurring inside active galactic nuclei}} (as part of the matter-recycling cycle)
\item
  \textbf{\hyperref[absolute-time]{SETI is unlikely to succeed}}, even if advanced civilizations exist
\end{enumerate}

Each of these will be discussed in greater detail in relevant sections
below.
