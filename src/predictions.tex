\section{Predictions}\label{predictions}

Although 2MM is not defined mathematically, it does make several
qualitative predictions that differ from standard interpretations and
could, in principle, be tested. These predictions arise directly from
the model's internal mechanisms: wave collapse, LCM/GCM interactions,
particle structure, and the matter-creation/destruction cycle.

\end{enumerate}

Each of these will be discussed in greater detail in relevant sections
below.
