\subsection{Why this is not the whole story}

2MM already assumes the LCM cannot be the entire universe. The
Copenhagen interpretation is not describing the deepest layer of
reality; it is describing the limits of observers confined to the LCM.
It leaves out:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  A deeper scale where \textbf{GCM corpuscles} move freely and do not
  behave as waves.
\item
  A domain where trajectories are crisp and not subject to LCM-wave
  uncertainty.
\item
  Energy budgets and mass formation pathways that lie outside the
  quantum regime.
\end{itemize}

Thus, the ``quantum limit'' is a \textbf{boundary of LCM-based observers}, not of the universe as a whole.
